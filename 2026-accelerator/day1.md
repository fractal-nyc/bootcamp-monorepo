## Day 1 Expectations & Schedule:


Expectations:
- 10 hours per day (M-S)
- Saturday is a short day, but still a work day, and still 3-5 PRs (by hand)
- Post-AI: 5-10 PRs per day.
- 

## Expectations: PRS (??)
- 

## Expectations: Tardiness - 

Exercise:

Open: short speech/presentation from Liam with a funny story (?) or something to demonstrate the point.
The point: "The best judge of your growth will always be you, and cannot be replaced or outsourced without great loss. We will also judge, but it will ALWAYS be inferior to your judgment."

What is our standard of excellence?:
- Liam hires engineers
- Andrew hires engineers
- We know what excellent engineering looks like:
- This is A STANDARD that you can BE SURE represents excellence, but it is not the only one.

The outcome we want:
- Students feel ownership over DELIVERING on their OWN personal standard of excellence
- We have a standard of excellence, too, and we will share it as a default standard that you ought to adopt, that we have seen former students accomplish.

What we will/won't do:


Will:
- Encourage you to continue to raise your aspirations and standards
- Give you materials, support, and feedback on your performance so you can exceed those standards


Won't:
- Parent you or discipline you or punish you. I'm just not interested in this game, I'm not going to use negative reinforcement on your behavior.
- If you feel like you need discipline from others, make it a priority to work with Mark and the coaches here to find a positive standard for yourself. This is your responsibility, and will never be anyone elses.


Program Evaluation & Exit:
- We may ask you to defer to the next program for a variety of reasons (though this is historically very rare):
1. Consistently failing to meet expectations
2. Not showing up to lecture
3. Basically if for any reason we believe that you cannot succeed in the program.

NOTE: We will have a holistic mid-term evaluation, with an oral exam and an engineering assessment.
- If you do not pass this evaluation, we will ask you to defer to the next program.
