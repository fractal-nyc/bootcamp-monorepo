Meeting Title: Bootcamp Week 1 -- Syllabus
Date: Jan 23

Transcript:
 
Me: Anyway, you just need to paste it into markdown somewhere and then I need Claude connect dude's not connected. As long as you have the transcript. Yeah. This is cool. This is. Fine. Okay, so. Things I want to change on the curriculum or on the expectations is like. I don't like this tardiness thing that we're doing anymore. I want to get rid of it and I want to come up with like a good policy. Instead. Or more like a psychology. Like a way to instill the mindset. Exactly like if you're not here you're wasting your time. Yeah, how would you do that? Like yeah, and we can think a little bit about like taking people out of the kiddie pool. That's something we've often said where it's like we're just treating you like professionals from day one. Yeah. I Andrew if this should be something that has enforced at the beginning of the program because like you said there's a power law distribution. Where like early discipline they just discipline. But you don't like crack the Andrew time. Right. I mean how have you seen this play out like what is typical dynamic. Basically what's typical is that. 20% of our students who literally cannot be helped. Struggle with this the Andrew cohort and then make it a part of their personality. So as in like late ones they're like yeah and like they're not cool about it. I just mean they like they start getting anxiety about it they're like I'm so sorry they're like oh the train a delay happened like and you're just kind of people that have problems with time and now it's just like okay now it just feels like part of your life is that you're late. And I just don't like that in a bad vibe and to be clear that is true like that is part of who you are and like that's gonna fuck you up. In your life but like do I want to solve that now? Not really. I kind of want that to not be myself the most important thing plus also in this industry like right the industry who cares? So I think what we want to do is we want to rewrite this to be something like we can ask questions about this. Yeah one is like. Let's say someone does like a 10. And like let's say half the people show up at like nine yeah if they don't have the people show up at 10 so there's a lack of overlap there does that fundamentally fuck up the vibes of the flow of the day at all? Not really like in week one it would have really bad but I think in week one we'll just tell people like look it's non negotiable yeah non negotiable like we have meetings every day like we're literally lecturing at nine. Right there's synchronous stuff so like you are going to be here and if you're late for the lecture. Like what the fuck you know you can't be late for your orientation meetings or whatever. But. But after that I think we'll move lectures to 10 or something. I almost want to do some kind of exercise with people where I coach them through instilling in themselves like looking at themselves in the mirror and saying like what's by that expectation for myself in this time I can sit whatever paragraph down the train yeah, but I know that I will like like I care more about someone telling me like like what they're going to do given who I am here's the best thing I can do. Like have a night out I'll be here it's almost like we want everyone to like yeah, we want everyone to like have a contract for themselves yeah exactly that's like how are you going to take advantage of this container and what expectation like what do you want us to hold you to dude what if every time like you show up every day and you just diff against what you did and what your contract says yeah so you're literally just forced to confront whether you fucked up against your own expectations yeah I don't know. Like it's not from without it's from within like if I show up every day at 12 noon but I stay till like 2 a.m working and that's just who I am right that's fine it's not like I fucked up I just that's who I am yeah. This gets also into like how do you measure performance how people are getting outside of that yeah but okay so this requires us to like have a prompt right so like remember any time that you imagine an exercise like this it can often be powerful but like. Because there are 20 people it needs to be like well structured youd have to have everyone do it simultaneously independently yeah yeah relying on me to go each person exactly so yeah so the way to do this would be something like you come up with a prompt that prompts them that's probably going to happen after a speech of some sort yes so like first you're going to like stage then you're going to prompt and then people are what are you going to journal on it or something? Or are you going to fill out a worksheet. I think the medium we'll figure out the medium but yeah like bring it back to just like what we want to have in people's minds and bodies. Like I think what we want to happen is we want people to give an honest assessment to themselves of like where I've been before in my life with respect to like my work ethic and what I cared about something did I show up for it yeah in a way that like didn't disappoint me. Like not did it make you get fired or did your boss get mad like yeah were you disappointed by yourself yeah and conversely like where was the time when you really showed up for yourself? Like that is like a thing that I want people to yeah bring to the space yeah as a benchmark right because like maybe my whole life I'm just like struggled to commit. Serious time towards any goal that I had right or maybe I haven't. Yeah and then that I think is the prime and then you could go into like okay here's the container entry right you tell them like here's what's necessary here so we want you to reflect given the kind of person you are maybe we can like come up with some. Easy categories to kind of self select into like I recognize I'm this far away from the boot camp like things people can pattern match against that give them a sense of like. Oh yeah I recognize myself and this this and this and therefore I'm going to kind of like bootstrap an expectation for how I work ethic looks based on these qualities that I see myself yeah. Because I feel like they'll feel like they own that at the end of it yeah like it's tailgate to them yeah and they were the ones who that's great so they want yeah some things we can do also is we can have them we can have them do like small groups where they share this yeah exactly like sharing this with each other know like yeah yeah they should feel like there's some accountability but not like. You clocked in like accountability it's like I care about being proud of myself and I care about other people being proud of me. So. Yeah. Maybe you want to bookmark that like we don't have to go a level deeper into actually structuring that I think that's more like yeah. I don't know what do you think do you want to like flesh that out or did you just want to leave that as an earmark for general policy. Do we have a day one. Do we have a day one schedule in here? I thought we did yeah first day. Let's put it into the first day at least. Oh like that should definitely happen the first day yeah yeah it needs to be day one and I do think like you said there needs to be some expectation that like okay regardless of what you think is going to work for you. Or so is that here from 10 to 10 30 like instead of expectations and structure there'll be a little bit of that but it's going to be like. Well what else used to go in here? We would cover expectations in structure. I mean what other things what did we put in our expectations structure? Youe. Know what I'm not sure that. I mean you can really just see it here it's like us expanding on these things. On. Tardiness ship three to five pull requests daily in review one pull request daily. Which I think we should get rid of these also by the way well really well I don't know it's cost serious thing that strikes based on just like tardiness that's tardiness but it's fake. Yeah because I never heard Rose enforced. Yeah people just knew it was enforced it's been enforced but like it's enforced very irregularly. And anyway like it's like three strikes and you're coached or something it's not like yeah it's just bad we just got to get rid of that why is the PR standard something you don't want. To like. Oh this is just more complicated now so like what I would rather have somebody do is max their clocks like what does that actually mean usages. What does it actually mean to like ship these days is a lot more complicated to me and it's less about pull requests although that's fine. But it's more like well it's called credits across the board right so it's not like you're running gas town and you're just like yeah a bunch of agents like you can just be. Doing getting call to instruct you or like learning from right it could be that we should still focus on pull requests at your company did you mostly still focus on pull requests? I mean I don't think anyone else I loved looking at my contribution gravity no sorry I'm just saying like the unit of work like the point here is more like just to highlight whatever a software engineering manager would would consider like a unit I've never I would never measure someone like you can kind of tell like okay no I'm just talking about the thing that you it's not you never measure a minimum that's not the point the point is what is the unit of work that gets judged like do you judge people based on their pull requests not the qual not the quantity but the quality. I would say I judge people based on. Delivering a project yeah within parameters of. Like. Is it so actually you don't review their pull requests? Increasingly less whoa I'm not saying no no that's good that's what I'm saying about this it's like do you think there's a far like it's east of bullshitting yourself in your running up so that people are lying on from scratch right like people are coming in with like a basal of knowledge but like it's easy to. Bullshit yourself into believing that. You're absorbing knowledge but you're not actually learning how to do the motion it's to me this is all about having a minimum amount of creative output yeah yeah I just don't know like if your claim because for even for me. The unit of creative output that was considered. Before all this AI stuff was the pull request like realistically you wouldn't ship a project like you're not shooting a project in a month. That's like even a short time horizon so within the sprint you have a two week sprint within the sprint you're being measured almost exclusively on your pull requests yeah not the quantity but the quality. Yeah I also think I don't know how you guys approach and obviously it's like features it's less to do with individual pull requests but pull requests and features match up very closely well there's a skill there too which is like how do you package something yeah in a diff that makes sense and it's not just like. Huge or random like slice through a couple different concerns that you're touching. Did you guys do code review like do you guys actually we do we do look at their code and we do code review and part of the reason that we do this pull request thing is so that we can do code review we don't review every pull request okay we just like we just skimmed but now we can have the eye review the moment. And we can have like rubrics and stuff that we the craziest thing just quickly is like that I think we should incorporate into our program is I saw Joffrey lit tweeting about how he gives himself he has quad give him a pop quiz on his own code. Like on the system he's built to make sure he understands it. S like giving making sure that you have concrete understanding of what you're producing yeah and you can't yourself like there's so bar to pass there's all kinds of stuff like that we can play with but. I still think this works because what else is there there's no other. Measurable needed about but yeah besides this. That. Like what else would there be can't think of anything. But projects are too low I feel like. Their feedback just not quick enough between like am I stuck am I frozen? And like. Like you get to the end of a month and it's like holy shit I don't have a project. Well we can set that expectation that you did like we assign a new project every day. Oh you haven't been shipped a project every single day we couldn't do that. Because the claw is so powerful. I do think these are like the kinds of things where we get to decide like cuz you can you can build the scope and sequence of those projects right so it's not like we yeah what I'm scared of is like people are going to get fast yeah but they're just going to skip learning because the tools are good. Enough for them to like. Well that's get that gets more into like program design stuff. Rather than syllabus. So yeah so the part of the syllabus that it seems like we want to be covering right now is we want to be covering scope and sequence so actually we want to cover this part of it. Oh it's not. It's not in here this is the orientation packet. It's this. Seems like we want to be covering this right now. So. Here I have kicking out the class will learn functional programming styling and test driven development by building and improving a game and then making a multiplayer it's like. Bro I will admit. I think our program is a fine way to learn software engineering but I'm like I'm highly sus. Here's like our diagrams of what's going on. I'm just highly sus of. This style I guess so this is this is getting into Scottie okay let's talk about a day let's talk about an average day. And let's just do this in a new just a trace where we went in the tree we were like at the day one schedule yeah then we went to. More communicating in that one block of time expectations block and then we kind of got down the scrabble of like PRs as a question mark yeah so we were yeah we were at day one. Expectations and schedule. And then PR. This is like an expectations thing. How do you all we need to put down for. Targeting this thing is just. Like. Set your own standard yeah and then like feel like you own it. And somehow reflect it back to you regularly yeah. Like say you want to stand up for your schedule and your workout let's go back to this for a second. Here. Expectations and structure. Success rubric evaluation cycle so this is instead of a valuation cycle this will be like. Definition of success. And then like. Self. Discovery. This is like roughly. I don't know is this right we basically there's a to do here right. Which I could put in my mind it's one like concrete output build a concrete exercise with output. Like if I had to guess what this exercise would be by the way this is like. Expectation yeah tardiness. Exercise. Open. Short speech. Slash presentation from Liam. With a funny story. Or something. To make the ice. To demonstrate. The. Point. The point. The only or the only judge the only like true. It's something like. The best judge is really like the best judge. Whether you're living up to your behavior. Yeah the best judge of. Your growth. Will always be you. And cannot be replaced. Or outsourced. At. Like. Without great. Loss. Essentially. Like external. Yeah. Yeah. But that's anyways yeah we'll we'll say it differently but the point is just like we need to get across to them that like we can't like we will also judge. But it will always be inferior. To your judgment. One thing I want to add like several statement is just like the outcome that I actually bought is that I want them to feel ownership. Over. Delivering. On their own personal standard of excellence yeah that's like what I care about yeah over delivery. On their own personal standard. Excellence. And like we'll nudge them we'll be like hey I think your set of excellence is like less than it could be right but. Yeah they're not going to believe they don't believe me it doesn't matter like yeah they need to feel like they own it. So yeah with the caveat that like we. Have a standard of excellence too yeah. And we'll have dialogue about you know being good actually looks like right. And we will. I don't know what pull up your like and we know yeah we we need to convince you. To adopt it or something I don't know something like this is great. Like basically there's kind of two types of students one type of student. Will be able to engage with this exercise. Because they're capable of adopting a standard of excellence and another type of student like really really needs an external standard of excellence because totally they don't know how so it's like we have a center of excellence too and we will share it. As. Like a default standard. That you ought to adopt. Like that we have seen all former students. It's not quite sure but essentially all form are successful students. Or whatever. We just like we have seen former students. Accomplished. I think that covers enough of the yeah okay maybe that's what this is it's like open like what is our standard of excellence? Right yeah like we have so it's like I hire yeah like a Liam hires engineers. Andrew hires engineers. We know what excellent. Engineering looks like. This is the standard. Like this is a standard. That you can be sure. Will. Like represents. Excellence but it is not the alum. Inum. Yeah something like that so it's like a like we're not we're not avoiding the question here is our standard of excellence. We will not yeah and then it's like what we will slash won't do. Will. Like encourage you to. Continue to raise your aspirations. And standards. Give you. Materials support and feedback. On. Your performance. So you can. Exceed those standards. I don't know. I don't think we necessarily need to go all the way down the leaves of this no I know but I just need I'm like just mainly because I want to get to wound like what I won't do is I won't. Like. Get mad at you. Like I won't like act like a parent I won't parent you. Or discipline you. Or punish you right I'm just not interested. In this game. Basically. I'm not going to use negative yeah I'm not going to use. Negative reinforcement. On your behavior. Yeah that's right if you need that. Make it a priority. To not need it. Now. What like if you feel like you need discipline. From others. Make it a priority to work with mark and the coaches here. To. Find a positive. Standard. For yourself. This is your responsibility. And we'll never be anyone else's. Yeah makes sense. Because that's like philosophy of expectations yeah how we sort of act at day to day at least high level yeah with the caveat that it's like. Program. Evaluation. And exit and then it's like. We may ask you to leave the program for a variety. Of reasons. So this is. Historically very rare. I'm sure you got this stuff already written. Down somewhere. Like red lines are like. You have a list of these things no because now it's changing. Because in the past I was like I'm gonna ask you to leave the program if you're late. Oh but I mean apart from like the stuff that's like performance management like there's obvious stuff right like like what are you about to write down. I'm about to write down mainly like. Consistently failing to meet. Like program expectation or consistently failing to meet expectations as. Discussed as agreed basically. I don't know something like that consistently meet expectations. Consistently or like. Not showing up to clutcher. Or. Whatever. Poopy poop. Y. What like the main reasons are like basically if you're crashing out. Like. Unable to. Well like your output is basically. For any reason. We believe that you. Cannot succeed in the program. And instead of loser program I'm just gonna say we may ask you to. Bill. Have a midterm evaluation. Like, a holistic midterm evaluation with an oral exam. A systems like, an engineering interview, Well, I mean, I'll just say an oral exam and an engineering assessment. And an engineering assessment. Does this like we could? No. I think it'll be something more holistic than that, but if you do not pass this evaluation, we will ask you. Something like Something like that. These are just things I wanna think about. I don't know if I'll publish this. This is roughly I'm thinking about doing this a little bit more than in the prior cohorts because, like, one problem we've had is we've never actually kick out a student. Except for like, behavioral issues. Right. And if we're if we're gonna, like, make this the most fun kind of Factorial esque company that we can. I think one flywheel that we can do is we can just, like, keep the standards really high. And just say, like, look. Just move to the next like, here. Go go next. Like, you're not you're not making it this time. Don't think we could like, I don't expect to do that three students or whatever. But I feel like the fact that I've never done it implies that I'm probably too scared. Pull the trigger on that. Or something like people like, you think of the people who you didn't Yeah. I can think of every cohort. There's about two people. People. And every cohort, like, where they end up on, like, proud of them. They've made a ton of progress. I'm sure it's been really good for them, but I but, like, I don't know. What's the downside? The downside to just leaving them in? I mean, there's not a huge downside. It's just stressful for us it just depends how much responsibility you wanna take. Like, it takes up more of your time and much longer to eat. They pick up, like, the two people who are the biggest problems, so to speak, would take up, like, thirty to fifth percent of the time. That we spend. Wow. Thinking about educating. Is that something you feel like I mean, it's kind of past that point now, but, like Yeah. Did you try to think about predicting that? Yeah. Yeah. Of course. We make the evaluations more difficult, and now Paris runs the evaluations. And he's, like, really big about this. Okay. So So you think they've been going forward? Because of that new process? Every cohort so far has been like, more Higher quality. Like, higher quality than the previous cohort. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I guess some But, like, they are students. You know? Like, it's never the case that we get a bunch of you know, genius engineers who could make some That would make no sense. Like that would make sense. But If we yeah. I don't think there's something we have to think about on day one. Yeah. Because I don't think we need to present someone with, like, the rubric by which you will be measured. Yeah. But I do think it would be important because especially because you're saying that maybe, like, there's a courage Yeah. Aspect to it. Having some way of semi objectively just assessing for yourself Infantative persons, they can feel like they were just, like, unfairly No. I agree. Targeted. But what that is Yeah. I don't know. I'm wondering what the standards are that we actually have announce. Announce. Like, concrete standards, Well, the more we can, the better, basically. I think we should announce I I think a schedule like, we were talking about feral friendly. Right? Yeah. Feral friendly to me means we can enforce, like, a minimum amount of time that you're the space. We can't enforce a schedule on you. Yeah. Does this seem right to you? Yeah. That seems right. So you can't say, like, you have to be here at 8AM. You can be like, you should be here for, like, roughly Ten hours a day. Ten hours a day? Yeah. Yeah. Like, if you're not around, you're not doing it. And, like, obviously, there's you know, medical reasons and whatever else. Yep. Like, that feels like a more objective standard of, like, You are here at ten hours per day. Monday through Saturday. And then, like You guys still do short days on Saturday? Yeah. And then Saturday is a short day. And four Still three different five. That's the kind of thing also where, like, don't know if this feels too I don't know how it feels. Yeah. What do you think of you saying yourself your own expectation, your own schedule Yeah. Every ten hours a day. We have some clock in and clock out system. Yeah. Yeah. We just have a way of signifying I've entered the space. I'm leaving the space. Yeah. That's, like, easy for us That's logical to us. Yeah. Right now, we do that in Discord. Okay. There's a message. The channel that's, like, attendance. You Like, on here? Yeah. Do you say I'm gone or leaving? No. But we could just have another channel. Okay. That's, like leaving. I need to say oh, no. We have an end of day channel. Okay. Cool. We love an end of day channel. Admittedly, end of day isn't about exactly when you're leaving, but it's like you're posting right of day status. Report. It's like I did a full day work today. Okay. I'm not even sure if that was interesting. But it does add, like Yeah. Is one of those things that's, like, extremely objective. Right. I was here for ten hours. I can see what the skew is of people's schedules. Yeah. I can understand roughly where people are. Right. Which is also helpful for us potentially to structure our time. Anyway just one thought. Yeah. Then we can graph it. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. And see, like, what people's circadian stuff. Right. So that's one. Ten hours a day. There's I do think, number of ERs pushed. Yep. Is good. I think we should just ratchet that Yep. Like I think should start it. Three four Right? And then one here. And then increase it? Yes. As you go through. Program, like Yeah. Presumably, you are learning all this stuff plus climb. You should have Yeah. I do think there's a pre clot and post clot. Right? I think it's, like, before clot. It's like three PRs. Three to five PRs, and this is, like, by hand. And then there's, like, postclawed which is, like, I don't know, five to 10 DRs. Do you like people want people to use the ad from the get go? In this most recent cohort? In the most recent cohort, what we do is we have week one, week two, week three. I can kinda go over those weeks with you. Yeah. Week one. No. Week one. Week one. Yeah. Teaching the fundamentals of programming computers using tic tac toe. Toe. So We're teaching kind of these asp these things in week one. Concepts. And systems, data and state, the reactive model, and specifically I don't know, client server model, basically. Sure. These are, like, instructor notes, not for the student. And these were, like, some of the problems that I was I was experiencing. And so week one, we go through kind of these exercises. One through five. We end with databases. But we're going through setting up tic tac toe on the front and the back end, styling it, server multiplayer, using sockets, databases. Then what is happening? The second week, we build a chatbot. Chatbot is requires authentication. And routing. So these are now, like, some of the new things that we're adding. Is a routes. Ts file. On the server, which is gonna have a bunch of different routes. That let you you know, post your freaking chatbot and get responses back. We also had Drizzle. So we we do databases again. This is another yeah. This is an example of authentication across the client and the server. Then this is an example of chat. We have this use chat thing which I think we need to get rid of from Brazil. It's just their SDK? Yeah. It's their SDK. Then here, we have a persistence. Thing where we talk about putting stuff into the chat table. Using React Router for this. But we can talk about that in a bit. Thinking about getting rid of it. And then week three, we do a group project. So this is your first large scale team project. What we do is we basically have people do a pitch give us a pitch. And then once they give us a pitch, we approve it, and then they just, like, go, like, crazy, and then they have a demo at the end the week. Actually, this this turned out really, really good last cohort. Like, people did some super cool things. But And your sense is they have enough for weeks one and two to produce something interesting. Yeah. And going back to the AI question, these are all without AI? These are all without AI, and then we do AI. So here we have drills. So AI assisted coding is with your greatest strength and weakness. After you've run through all these drills with ease, we'll set you loose to experiment with AI assisted coding for the rest of the week. So, basically, we have a bunch of drills, which we cover here. And then once people kind of drill these fundamentals, so there's four different types of drills that we give people. And once they get good at this stuff, what we do is we, like, approve them. So we go review their work. Come to us, they're like, I think I did it. And we're like, okay. Yeah. You passed this drill. Now you can move on to, like, this one or whatever. And then when they're done, we give them AI coding. We basically just say, like, look. Nobody knows what works, but here's a bunch of advice. Here's spectrum in development. Which is not even valuable anymore. Here's a video. Is, like, a demonstration. I would include this blog post that we just found. Yeah. For instance. Basically, we're just like, okay. We're in the AI era. And then in week five, now we're giving we're having people build some kind of advanced AI. System. So they have to, like, build an agent or they have to build some kind of AI assisted coding or they I don't know. Something like that. I'm just like, I kind of get where the lecture or the sitting and helping goes for at least one through three. Yeah. Like, when you're getting to this stuff, Yeah. We this is where it's this is why I said it drops off dramatically. You basically just don't. Lecture much almost at all. You're sending them off to a pre curated setting. It's like it's like every week, what we do is we, like, take pitches from the students on what they're gonna demo that that weekend Right. Like that Saturday. And then we're just like, okay. Yeah. That sounds good. You go off and build that. Cool. And then So they're just building it through. And then they're just building it throughout the week, and then they just demo and and then we're just pretty brutal at demos. So it seems like by week four, they have basic web programming. Mhmm. And they have, like, a really super basic stuff. Yeah. And they have, like, maybe an understanding of how the like, AI SDK works. Yep. And then they start to learn, like, the ergonomics of using AI tools somewhat. Do you feel like when you saw projects coming out of that, coming out of students or student teams, post, like, week three or week four. You were like, clearly, I've given them all the tools they need to bootstrap more sophisticated understanding. Or you were like, oh, actually, it seems like there's something fundamentally missing in their mental model that's like, Depends the student. You just can't say, I don't know. It's not possible on, like, a class basis. What I'm getting at is, like, I wonder what I wonder if anything what if anything we need to add to the curriculum of weeks one through three or change it up? Much. Okay. Have it on the board, monthly. This part? Yeah. Memorization and modeling. We only have, like, the stuff in week one and week. Two. But we could we need to, not just could. We need to add more models. For people to learn throughout weeks. Three through 12. Cool. So, like, we have, like, an off flow in stuff. But we also never test them on that. So, like, I would really, really, really like to give them Blue Book exam. Every week. That's, like, can you please just draw for me off? Just draw it. And then I'm just gonna fucking grade it. By hand. I'm just gonna quickly Like, offline. I'm literally just gonna quickly offline like, review all these blue books. And I'm just gonna, like, check your model of op and be like, okay. Do you have a concrete model of auth? Doesn't need be perfect, but, like, it's a draw bike. Like, you know you know if it's running. Do do if they don't? Like, do you just You would, like, red line it. You you yeah. You'd red line it, and you'd have them take the test again. You just have them keep submitting blue book. No. I need to speed tests. Like, what is your model of, like, fixing that gap? For them? Between tests. Yeah. I I wouldn't do that. I'd live in Epstone. Their study methods are up to them. Okay. Would just expect them to know. I haven't I would I would also give them a lecture, obviously. But Yeah. I have an idea. Yeah. You're feeling the skills right. Mhmm. Weeks one through three, Yeah. They can't run code with AI. But let's say, just to give them familiar with the cloud environment Yeah. You can pull up cloud in your terminal, and you can use one of these skills Yeah. Say there's a skill called database design. Right. Right? It can it'll have just, like, a all the abnormal forms it is. Right? Like, whatever you wanna tell them about it. Yeah. And you're allowed to use that as, like, we recommend that you use this knowledge base Yeah. With this model in this two in this terminal UI to ask your questions. About this topic. Yeah. I don't know if that's like, the base model probably knows it, but I'm just like, I kinda wanna hand people from the get go away to bootstrap their own understanding of these tools. Mhmm. It's, like, very curative. Yeah. The thing I don't want is, like, I don't wanna invent a I don't want to invent a body of knowledge that, like, is like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't wanna have to be maintaining a body of knowledge that is consistently getting out of date. So, like, anything that anything that is, like, definitely never gonna be out of date, I'm, like, board. Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking about life. What clients are modeling Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Stuff like that. It's like relational data. But don't you feel like the base model is just gonna have all stuff so well? Maybe it I think there's something to be said. Well, also, isn't there, like, something to be said for learning how to navigate the base model to learn these things? Let me show you something. Yeah. If I might, I guess, the last thing I'll say about this is, like, you skills are a way to, like, narrow the behavior of your model. Yeah. We can program a little teacher. Check this out. This is chapter one of a computer science program. Just chapter one. That's all it is. That that one of my students took after they took my program. They took? What do mean? They're, like, taking this program at at CMU. Okay. It's called the tour of computer systems. Yes. It is a 23 page PDF. Okay. With pros. Right. It has how many sections? It goes from one point you know, one all the way to 1.1, is the last section. And how many diagrams does it have? It has I don't know, at least one. Yeah. That's a figure. We have figures. 1.6, 1.1. It has, like, 15 figures. No. More. 17. 18. Has 18 figures. And it covers things like instruction level parallelism, concurrency, how systems communicate with other systems, what systems files, threads, virtual memory, processes, the operating system, storage devices, caches, main memory processor, buses, IO devices, hardware organization, processors, Like, my what I would like this is my dream, I would like them to do something of this level every week. Go through something like this. Like like, go and have an exam on it. Like I would like to deliver to them a PDF of roughly this like, density every week and test with a test. And the test is attached. It's at the bottom of the PDF. Okay. Does that make sense? Let's think about this. And like why do I want that? I just think it's it's the missing piece. It's like I have all the practical stuff down pretty well but reading this really actually genuinely only takes you, like, forty five minutes. Yes. To an hour. Right. Memorizing everything in it takes you another three to five hours Right. That's not that much time compared to how much value you get Like, if you have this comprehensive view of computer systems, the, like, the way you're changed I feel like is this is gonna fundamentally change how you think about Claude and how you think about computers and stuff like that. And you're never no matter how many hours you spend in Claude, you're never gonna get here. It's just not happening. And you'll never be able to say, like, hey, Claude. I want to do x, y, and z at this level of the computer. Yeah. You just don't know that that's Right. An ancient vocabulary. Okay. So this is kind of interesting because you can imagine there's a loop here. And I'm a little bit worried because this you have a working model. Right? Yeah. So, like, with any of this stuff, have to, like, think about you said three to five hours. It seems like a good Yeah. You know? Time box. But, like, how much it displaces the existing pedagogy or whatever Yeah. That already works. But this is, like, I'm not sure to say It's synergistic, though. Lot of people, like, burn out. You can't just, like, work for six hours. Know? Yeah. Grind on my pussy. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm realizing is that, like, the core value of this program to me feels like the special thing could be we turn you into the kind of person that takes a PDF like this and you're able to fully make it like actionable in your own life. You internalize it. You memorize what it's necessary to use it. In your daily work. Yeah. Whatever else. But what we're teaching you is, like, we're giving you the material, but we're teaching you the means of teaching yourself that material. Yeah. Like, the instruction is actually more about how to learn and boost up your knowledge and then apply it within this, like, all these AI workflows. Yeah. Yeah. It's possible. I'm not actually confident something like this needs to be made practical. But I agree that like, the equivalent one on the client server architecture would be made. Very, very practical. Yeah. I guess I don't mean practical. I mean, like, it's in your body now. It's Yeah. Exactly. It's in your body Yeah. And furthermore, you didn't learn it because, like, I stood in front of you lecturing about it. You learned it in the same way you're gonna learn things for the rest of career, which is like Yeah. You're gonna read them. You're gonna have certain methods for teaching yourself things. Right. So we should I don't know if you guys talk do you guys, like, touch on, like, ways people should teach themselves things? No. But it'd be great. Yeah. I agree. I like the idea that we don't even lecture on this. Right. Just give them the PDF and the Blue Book exam. Right. And then methods. Like, you're at Claude skills. But, like memorization methods. Yeah. And then so maybe at the bottom of this, there's, like, exam and then, like, methods learning methods. Excuse me, guys. Right. Yeah. Right. I saw you glued No problem. Anyway, That's something I mean, what's nice about this is this doesn't feel like something you would wanna do weeks one, two, and three. Like, correct me if I'm wrong. Like, I don't think you would wanna introduce this kind of extra loop. Not in week one. In week two, you'd be surprised how fast they move. I think in week two, yes. Week two would actually be the right week to introduce If we didn't get around to it, we'd be okay, but I think it would be the right week. Because people are starting like, basically week one, people are overwhelmed. And week two, people are already adjusting and starting to feel like oh, like, there's not enough structure sometimes. That's not to say and that's only, like, 30% of our students. So it's like people are have different levels. I actually think one of the valid critiques of our program is the students will say something like there's not enough structure. That's not the actual problem. The problem is something like, I think we don't we don't structure the domain of computer science enough. For them. Mhmm. And instead, we leave them to explore it on their own. But I think we we should just be doing both. Like, we should have a barbell strategy. And this would help with that. So the new content, it sounds like, is gonna be more fundamentals of computers? I'm not saying fundamentals. I have the models already written. What? Me fuck is my June? Okay. Yeah. I wrote them. Oh, here. Computer architecture request response cycle, render loop, game loop, authentication process, CRUD, REST, MVC, modern LLM, that's just like like, what is the DKA? Or whatever. An agented system with a harness, a self debugging loop. So this is more like the engineering design process or, like, what you go through as an engineer. Complete production web system. And I have a bunch of things that go in the, like, storage database logs, logging authentication. Services, client and browser, caching, deployment. And then TypeScript, relational database management systems, the JavaScript event loop. The terminal. Those are, like, That's the landscape. Yeah. Those are some. I I feel like if they had those, I'd be like, okay. Great. Sure. That does really, really good. Like, here's another thought I have. And maybe this is, like, fucked up. I kinda feel like the problem with a computer science degree isn't necessarily that they did a bad job of compiling PDFs like this. Yeah. I feel like the problem might be that they did a bad job of creating the environment. For the students to at their best pace, like, to to rapidly learn. Sure. If what we believe is that we have a superior environment. To the university, Like it's more fun, we have better mentorship, and we have better learning methods. For students. Maybe we should just be jacking PDFs like this. I kinda think that's true. And so, like, instead of I don't think there are I don't think we're gonna be able to compile stuff that's better than this super easily. I don't think you and I I value by like deciding to write a new textbook. Effectively. Yeah. Or, like, deciding to come up with a brand new way to teach web programming. Right. Programming, it's like the value is, like, again, it's like the meta loop of, like, Right. Giving people a space for their motivates. We would need to write the the value evaluations. But Oh, sure. Yeah. Give yeah. Giving people the motivation, giving them mentorship. Support, Yeah. Social space. And special stuff. Like, Yeah. We're gonna pre premake all these, like By the way, you wanna see my favorite I should just share share it with you some things. My favorite way to learn computer science on the Internet right now is the CS Primer. Built by a guy I really believe in. I have a subscription I pay $50 a month for this. But basically, here is just what it goes through. Programming beyond the basis, computer systems, algorithms, structures, computer networks, operating system, relational data, systems. And the way that you learn is he assigned some supplementary textbooks for each one Yeah. But more importantly, you, like, pick a problem and then you solve the problem. And then you do that over and over again.  
Them: Welcome to pro  
Me: And then he's just he's actually curated is a series of problems rather than and videos. That explain things. But it's unfortunately not the PDF. Like, it's not read I really wish it was reading. I don't know if it's because he, like, just doesn't have the resources or but, yeah, he has this he has this idea of pick a starting point and then focus on problems. Like, you know, don't spend as much time, like, reading and listening and watching videos and stuff like that. Yeah. See, because much help is needed, but no more. As well. So it's possible also that we could take his method? Like, it just depends how much we believe in this this method. Of focusing on problems. To learn computer science. Like, because of Claude, I don't I'm actually not sure. Like, it might be the case that focusing on modeling rather than solving the problem is better I could very well see that that maybe like, writing algorithm for myself I just don't know, man. This is the biggest question for me is, like, I'm I'm a guy who is classically I learned to code. Yeah. But I don't look at my code anymore. Yeah. So what does that mean? Does it mean I needed to learn to code? In order to make it so that I can't look at my code anymore? Or does it mean that actually there's now a new way, which is, like, focus on the higher level abstractions. You focus on the boxes and arrows. And you know when to open up the box. You're not an idiot. You're not a dummy. You aren't taking shortcuts. But you are focused on a higher level of abstraction. Yeah. Yeah. I just don't know. And if I knew the answer to our yeah. If I just knew what our opinion was on that, then I guess it would be easier to, like, make judgment calls in every case. If you look out on the edges of the system, right, like, let's say you deploy something in production. Right? Yeah. Let's say you had a business, that operated for, like, a hundred years. Yeah. Because software engineers use cloud to and things gets put into production. Yeah. Think it's operated for, like, a hundred years. Yeah. It also that time. How do you know like, do you answer the questions that you just state? About that system? Like, does it matter if they look to the code? It's not the wrong it's this is not the correct question. Right? Yeah. But there's something where there is a situation, operational situation, or like, hey. Product requirement situation, where you can't be blocked by the inability to read the code. Yeah. And you don't wanna just be below the API line. And you also need to be able to ask for what you need. Need. I actually think that's not like, yeah. But the things I need like, what do I need? I need to be able to see the system like, to be able to visualize it. I need to know that there's, like, data I need to be able to look at the database. I need to run some tests maybe. But, like, it's all but introspection. It's all about being able to see. It's like I'm I'm building ways of seeing. Yeah. It's actually not the the former kind of understanding that we would be used to, which is like do you know how to code up the ways of seeing? Because now you can just, like, make little tools that see. For you. Maybe. I don't know. Yeah. I mean, pulling this down a level, like, you're training people for today's market? Right? Like, Yeah. But today's market is it's moved on. Like, it's fast. It's moving. It's very fast. Like, your students get jobs. Yeah. Like, if you got retroactive I have a lot of students who don't read their code. Code in their jobs. Their jobs today. And how do they do a good job? Based on whether they pass tests. And don't break production. And what like, yeah, I guess And deliver the feature. The question you wanna know is, like, what is the connection between what you did here Yeah. What you did there? And Yeah. What they're capable of doing there. Like, how they never learned how to code? Would they be able to create code? By asking for it and then pass tests and not break production? Yeah. I think so. Actually, have a strong opinion on this. Yeah. The the skill we're teaching is not already coding. Anymore. It's reading code. Yeah. The outside like, the huge our thing known as I was just, quality Like, assessing the quality of code. In an automated way. Right. And then also just, like, being able to read and skim code and be like okay. This checks out. Yeah. Maternalizing what this does. I can spot the smells. Right. We can use automated quality whatever. Yeah. Like, John Freeman's whole thing. He's like, how do I quiz myself on what my kid does? Need to understand it. Right. So it's not like, how do I physically invite? Fingers type? Or think about typing the thing That's just a proxy for how am I thinking about structuring the problem. Yeah. I really need to train my ability to evaluate solutions. Right from that. Yep. Does that seem I think that seems right. Okay. Can I I'm gonna gonna take the exact opposite? Stance for a second. Just because I just because I still know. When you do you do you remember the feeling when you solve like, an advent of code? Yeah. Like, the kind of, like, shape rotating that's going on. Yes. And then when that happens but it's for the client server. Like, same feeling, but for, like, HTTP. Like, you've now sent a request and you've received it on your client. Yeah. And now you can read the request object. Right. So there is such a thing as the request object. The request object's in memory. You can inspect its elements. Yeah. You can pull the data out of the body. Yeah. And you, like, start to, like, comprehend, like, oh, yeah. There is a body. There is a request. And he's, like, met previously, like, abstract ideas now almost, like, become like, the way I think of it is, like, it becomes at hand. It's sort of like, oh, yes. Like for it. I have the request. You believe it exists. Oh, can't I use the yeah. Yeah. Basically, you believe it exists now. You're like, oh, can I use like, I just use the request to get the request headers or whatever? You're like, yeah, exactly. You have the request. Request. You can use it to get the request headers. Obviously, you can do that. And and if somebody doesn't see it, you almost think they're an idiot. You're like, they're like, oh, you're like, oh, dude. It's probably in the headers. They're like, oh, in the headers? How do I get that? And you're like, Right. Bro, are you fucking stupid? Like, the headers. Well, it's like you said they were like, where's the deli? They're like, it's not Bumbo Street. Right. I don't fucking know where that is. Like, I've never been there. So that has nothing to do with reading code in my opinion. Like that feeling is a feeling that comes from digest it's like you've you the medium is the code. You're like, oh, the request opt you you've begun to see the code is real. Yeah. And the way that you're reading the code is you're like, oh, yeah. There's these, like, all these real objects. That interact with each other. Yes. And I I I I know them. Yeah. Is that important? Like, are you knowing them? My point is sort of like I think that's important. No, my point is like coding has always been about moving up the layers of abstraction. Yeah. So it could be that, like, all the things like, it is very important that you have that feeling about things. So, like, it is important that you you begin to know things. Yeah. And you begin to be able to use them. Yep. But I'm just wondering if there's things that you can know and use that are even higher than, like, the request object. Can we, like, know and use just testing? Can we just, like, know and use authentication? Like can you just start to look at an authentication system and squint like you're saying about reading? Basically, the dilemma here is like is the only way to know an authentication system to begin to believe in an off object or like, implemented in JavaScript. Or is it possible to know authentication via, as you were saying, just like reading an authentication system. And noticing that there was a bug in it. And then catching that in an exam. Multiple times. And you're like, okay. Like, you can actually realistically debug an off system. Even via, like, hand inspection. Or something. Yeah. Because you, like, developed some other sense. That we can't even comprehend necessarily yet because we're not good enough vibe coders. I mean, if your ambition is to, like, figure that out in the course of running this cohort, Then we should just bet on it? Well, no. Actually, I'm I'm kind of, like, I'm hesitating to extend my emissions that far. Because I believe I do believe, Yeah. That you can give someone, like, a way better learning experience for the object at hands that you're talking about and, like Yeah. Feeling like I can recombine them, like, later is, like, no problem. With the AI as my medium. Yeah. I feel less certain about what it would mean to totally hide that from someone and just be like, it's off. Or it's Kaiser or it's testing. Again, I also think it actually does someone a disservice. Yeah. To, like, not be able to scale that ladder I don't even know what that would mean. Like, off is not this, like, monolithic. Thing. The units of composition need to be smaller than that. Well, yeah, when you taught OAuth, you'd be teaching, like, the OAuth. Model and then the Right. Password Like, there's only a few types of authentication. Like you're exchanging you're exchanging private information for a public key, or you're using a public key plus private information in exchange whatever data. It's like you were the computer, Yeah. And I was asking you to build something for me, Yeah. I would have to start naming things to you. Yeah. Then I would have to evaluate whether the thing you built matches my understanding of what I want. Okay. Here's here's really my point. I guess god. This is so fucking hard. Who cares? Like, what if we just increase the expectations for output? The student? From prior cohort? So we're just like, look, guys. You have Claude now. Like, we're just expecting way more from you. Here's the list of projects that you will correctly deliver. Here are all the subsystems in the project. And what we're gonna do is we're gonna highlight every subsystem And guess what? You are expected to know how the code works, but guess what? You still have more expectations than prior cohorts because, like, coding has gotten easier. And like, you have to know you have to be able to draw out the system. And you have to be able to know all the subsystems. And maybe like, I guess my point is like if someone if someone does it, like if they deliver the thing and the thing is the best thing of any student who delivered it, And then I asked them like, okay. But now open a blank text editor. And write me an authentication system, And they're like, what are you talking about, boomer? Yeah. Do I care? Does it matter? No. I don't think so. And so my question is, like, do we have faith that it is possible to do better by trying to go directly after the outcome that we want. Or do we feel like there are these intermediary steps that we went through that you have to do without actually going directly at the outcome you want. Because if I personally was building a system today, and somebody and, like, you know, like, okay. Another way of putting this is, like, let's say you're teaching Jocs to to code. Let's say I was teaching mean, Priya already knows software engineering. But, like, let's say I was teaching my sister to code. Yeah. Your sister doesn't code. We're teaching our sisters to code. They're younger. They're Gen z. Our we realistically gonna be like, here's a here's CS primer. Like, go solve all these fucking problems. I don't think so. I feel like we're doing some bullshit. No. And why? It's because I think that would be wasting their time. Like, I don't I don't wanna waste my sister's time. Thing about the experience, okay, just a second, like, think about the experience of building something and, like, I don't want that experience. Like, there's two possible Yeah. One is, like, I can lean back in my chair. And I can in my head, kind of just, like, think about all the concepts that I know exist. All this felt at hand objects. Like, I can kind of, like, them together in my mind. Yeah. And then I can ask the computer for that. Mhmm. We're probably building analysis, and I'm thinking about starting with this part. Yeah. This is this. Versus their experience of, like, Hey computer, I want an off system. Okay. Now I've got 20,000 lines of code. Yeah. That's like, the latter is not it may be where we're going. No. No. I know I I know I know what you're pointing at. What I'm saying is we can't police. Like, we have to be very, very careful. About what we what we can evaluate. What we can ask for and what we can police And so we need to do some kinds of, like, bimodal or, like, multimodal barbell strategies. We need to be Yeah. What we need to do is we need to be like, look. The truth is the only thing that matters is the outcome. That's the truth. Wait. If you want a job. Like, the truth is that the market cares about outcomes. Yes. And so does everyone else. Like Yeah. That none of the nothing else matters. We need to really convince them of that. Then we're like, we will judge you on outcomes. And here's the rubric and here's how we are going to evaluate you. Like we're doing demos every week and we expect like, good work. But if you don't know how to produce good work you have a problem. And here's systems. So it's like on the one hand, we only care about outcomes. The other hand, in order to produce outcomes, need to learn systems. And here's all these systems that we're gonna teach you. And then maybe, like, one more thing which is, like, problem solving. So it's basically like maybe we maybe we talk about three categories of things, which is, like, outcomes, systems, problem solving. And maybe problem solving just do admin codes and lead codes. And we're just like How do know it's great? I don't know, bro. Just like we do shit like this. We're just like, look, you actually don't have an AI. Yeah. But these are very simple. Dude, actually, myself. Just learn any language. Like, Python, learn JavaScript. I don't care what your of choice is, but like just you should be able to should be able to solve little puzzles without the AI. And that's problem solving. Yes. I personally Mhmm. Personally, this is just, like, the industry hasn't been in me code yet. Yeah. But, also, like, I wanna believe that I can still Yeah. Do the shape rotation. Right. I don't wanna lose that. Maybe that'll simply But I I wanna do the reps I wanna go to the gym and, like Yeah. Lift weights. So I'm like, if I'm putting my job, I still wanna go to the leak code. Yeah. Stay sharp. Right. And I do actually think that Oh, so you believe in problem solving. I believe in forcing people to be capable of sitting down and solving, like, some bar of the code. Yeah. Fast. Okay. So we're saying That's that's just one piece. Yeah. We're saying that there's what we will call problem solving. Yeah. Which is just 20 problems. It's using 20 problems, and on AI assisted, Yeah. And these are, like, toys. Yeah. But this is the gym. We think of this as, like, rec. It's the gym. And, also, it is what allows you to drop down if you need to to the level of, like, single line of code. Cool. And apprehend it. Yeah. If you train this, I think you actually Yeah. Keep you keep the lowest lead ladder of extraction. And then two this is systems. So these are all the medium ladders. So, like, we can also call this abstractions. System's Yeah. This is the object in hand. This is the stuff that if you drown a system on whiteboard, Yeah. These would be the boxes. It's like boxes and lines. Yeah. So you should be able to draw stuff. Yeah. Is basically, like, you you should be able to logic. And reason. And we could And read. And then this is, like, you should Should be able to plan. Be able to draw. And remember. Right? Remember? You like, a lot of these models are gonna come from memory. Memory. You should be able to, like, remember how auth works. And, like, why? Because auth we're auth is principle. Like, remember according to principles. There's, like, facts about the world that make it so much easier memorize off. Because you're like, well, fundamentally, is off meant to do so that it's also about, like, purpose. Right? And, like purpose. You know, like, what's meant to keep things safe? So if I if if my office had authentication system was a system system that allowed somebody to read my secret key. Right. Like, it's like, how do you know that you don't send the secret key to client? It's like, well, That's a really good question. You know that you can't have, like, Zebra key to the client. Five Yeah. It's like yeah. Exactly. Wait. Also, is the other thing on this I don't know if this is worth touching on, Yeah. In a program, but, like, computer systems in practice, software engineering is just not about producing a static artifact and you're done. Yeah. There's, like, a living system Right. And you build yourself into different sets of constraints. Yeah. Depending on how you build it. So this part especially is important because not just because you wanna, like, understand what happened. You play it. But also, like, the way you build your system today constrains how you can change it tomorrow. Yeah. That's true. That's primarily done at this level. Right? It's not done No. Not at No. Because then I can just throw away and rebuild code. But if your system has all these, like, Yeah. Architectural things in it, Yep. You guys still doing Grotkin Simplicity? Is that still I it's in the off of that, I guess? It's in the curriculum. I think I would remove it. Cohort, maybe. Because it's very much about functional programming. And I'm like, less conf confident in code construction education. Like, there was a long time where I was educating people on code construction because I was like, well, an important part of reasoning about a system is, like, being able to identify parts of it. So you identify the data You identify the actions. You identify That is this now. Right? system and how do they fit together? Yes. But, like, it it's really, really about the construction. Like, it's not I the concepts you can import into this context now, but I don't I think I think this stuff might need to be more Like, this is a little bit more like that PDF I was showing you in my This is like the PDF. And this is like college. College is, like, interested in this kind of thing a lot, actually. Right. Like, universities love this kind of knowledge. Right. This is, academic knowledge. And then They also love this kind of knowledge because it's No. Actually, college has never taught me any of this. Algorithms and stuff, like dynamic programming, Like They they only taught me this stuff about it. They taught me like, they gave me, like, all the models today. Programming and all the models solving algorithms. Completions of it. Yeah. But they were never like, can you actually do Yeah. Yeah. They're not, like, go to the gym. They're just like This is about reps. So this is, like, this is the Yeah. So who cares about this? Like, honestly, you just you should care about it. And then this thing is like so we can off or the market, you could say. Right. This is where this step overlaps the money. Vercel as an AI SDK. Like, remixes that web framework. Like Yeah. And this is basically just, like, outcomes. Yeah. And at this point, these days, this is just like a lot. Dude. This is all plot. Yeah. Everything like, any other, like, any other strategy is just the bad the wrong The right strategy for getting that We're putting this into practice? Yeah. Like, learn how to use this tool. There's no other tool that you need That's the only one. There is, like, a mono tool now. Yeah. Basically. I mean, with the caveat that, like, there's a million something. Sub tools that you're gonna have to learn to get outcomes you want. This is like your daily knowledge. Right. Exactly. Wanna find out what's out there, what your options are for web free, framework or whatever. Right. Ask. The client. Yeah. But, like, you also need to be able to define you need to be to know what you want also. Also. Unfortunately. That part's hard. Well, that's why you really need to get this done. You can't ask, like, what should I use for x y z? Well, I'm saying you you need to know what real world that could be, unfortunately. That that could be the hard part. Like, knowing that you want to build that for your mom, is, like, actually a fucker. The only thing you wanna that your wanna build that for is Oh, yeah. I guess it's not talking about Like, these models help you know what to build. They'll they'll help but not what. What you're So wouldn't you this is a lot to give How SP like? Revamped to some We only do this. Like, we only do this right now. But the caveat comes. Yeah. Okay. Like, we're we're extremely, extremely practical. Because you can find the the old way. The old way was that there wasn't a plot. So in order to get the outcome, you had to do these. You could not you could not skip them. Yeah. Right. Right. So I I had a theory that was like, well, if you solve tic tac toe, then you're gonna learn this model. And by the way, we do have those graph we have those diagrams. What about stuff? Then that kind of implies that, like And then you're gonna solve these problems. But So why not just continue to do it that way? Because I don't believe in it. Like because because, again, in the past, I really, really told people outcome they actually want. Did something I I really was telling them, like, the outcome that you actually want is to build a multiplayer game. Game. Right. The only way to achieve that is to do it by hand. So, like, now I'm lying to you. It's like, why not just do it the way that we did before? It's like, well, because then they'd be doing all the be saying literally a week. On an arbitrary throwaway problem that they could have won job with the clock. Code. Like, that is way too demoralizing. But if they one shot, they don't learn anything from it. Correct. That's why we need a new curriculum. But I guess we're saying okay. If we were just saying in the process of building something, you've learned it. It. If you watch out of Klein, clod, you don't learn it. Because That's not true. Of course, you learn it. If you want time with thought, you do learn it. You learn how to do it. But not really. Like, I still need to understand No? You think for Prove it. I mean, it's like, what am I doing every day? I'm using cloud for everything. But I still understand what I'm Do you have to? Yeah. Okay. Well, then you have to. But did they have to No. They do have to. Person who built tic tac toe. Like, my point here is, like, you're doing a thing to the students, which is, like, you're treating them with disrespect. Disrespect. Like, we can't do that. You're disrespecting them by forcing them to do stuff that they could have done by one shotting a paw code. We can't do that. Like, we can't give them an assignment that they could have one shot with cloud code. We just can't. I'm not okay with Okay. I understand what you're saying. You're saying, like That's very disrespectful. So I thought of output, level of outcome and admission is to be raised. Right. Such that you actually still have to understand this stuff Yes. Even if steering Yes. Okay. Exactly. So And then and then I think you need to practice problems. Solving. Like, just run those reps on the side? Yeah. Literally on the because I just don't think you'll ever do this part. Yeah. This is actually the most legible and easy to measure part process. Yeah. It's also done. Like, every student could probably say should have, like, I don't know. I don't know how to mention that. Yeah. I don't know what environment we measure it in. Like, it's yeah. But does that make sense? It's sort of like what I'm scared of doing Like, basically, you could really could do this. And we could make a mistake. And not even realize we made it until after. We could have twelve weeks where they never knew anything impressive. Because we just keep thinking, oh, what's actually important is that you're learning. That's not what's actually important. Yeah. What's actually important is that they build shit. Like, if we believe that you can build a company with thought in a week, we should have them build a company with fire. A week. Like, if we believe that you can change the world with Claude, then we should have them change the world with Claude. There's no excuse for us not to look seek the limit of what somebody with their level of experience can do with Claude. And have them approach that limit. Yes. So we need to find the limit. That's just what's really scary. Is, like, if we can't find the limit, or, like, we we set it wrong, then people will crash out, but it's okay like that. I handle And if we have this other material for them, to work on, like, they'll have maybe they'll feel like it's okay even if they're crashing out a little bit. I don't know. That part's harder to think about. And for what it's worth, like, if we fail at that task, come up with better better projects that are, like, for the Claw era, then, yes, I think we could run back our current program and because the market doesn't move that fast, like, it'll be okay. But I just worry like, I just wanna give them like, literally the best thing that exists. Exists. Sure. Is this also roughly the order in which you wanna teach this stuff? No. No. The opposite. Always gonna serve. Outcomes. Okay. That's what motivates people. Okay. And that's why you start with my programming. Yeah. You get them to build something in there. Like, hey. I can do it. Yeah. Exactly. And then once they can do it, start to, like, down all the things that's happening inside magically. You break it down as they're doing it. Right? So it's like Yeah. What you do is you motivate them to do it. And then you tell them what is inside. Like, as you introduce the thing, Yeah. And then they're like, they're, like, kinda half listening a little bit. And then they run into a problem, and they're like, this problem's really hard. I'm like, do you remember what I told you? What was inside? Now I'm actually gonna, like, really tell you what was inside. And That's true. I actually do remember this from when I, left over here. I kinda just, like, used Firebase until I actually need to understand what's happening. Yeah. And then explore that box and further explore that box. Exactly. You can You just build it, and then you explode the box. Boxes. And you use this to explode the boxes? Yes. And then use it to understand how to rebuild. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Makes sense to me. So at least okay. Studying back from, like, curriculum design for a second, Yeah. If we think about tactically the next week or two, Yeah. Like, I like, let's say you get all equity stuff sorted out. Yeah. I give notice on Monday. Yeah. That means there's a two week clock where I'm still Yeah. I know. Doing a lot of stuff. Right. And so I kinda wanna figure out if you between you, Paris, David, and myself, Yeah. Like, how much of this do we need to build before day one? How much of Well, technically, like, need need is very weird. It's like if we did nothing, what would happen is Paris, David, and I would just run back the exact same. Syllabus Okay. That we did last cohort. Like, we have slide decks. You have no doubt that on day one, you could just rinse and repeat get the exact same thing done. If you were super ambitious. Yeah. Have no doubt that I could do that. Okay. I just think that it would be wrong Like, it'd be wrong No. I agree. He'd be wrong like, philosophically, I guess. Yes. And so but but it would be fine. Yeah. I say need, it's not like Yeah. Yeah. We literally don't need to do any of To avoid the the I mean, we do have a curriculum from the last cohort. I just run it back. What's what's your frame? Like, I think what I'm asking you is, like, where do you wanna be in I want to be? Week one. Of the program. Yeah. What I all this stuff. What I want is I want to have like, and this this part's hard because it's like, I need to do it with you. There's, like, not another person to do it with. Right. Because you're the one who's gonna be thinking about this stuff with me. But it's like I wanna have a philosophy for my cohort. Like, I wanna I want a cohesive philosophy. I wanna just know what I'm doing. Doing. Because right now, I'm still feeling kind of lost where I'm like, I'm torn between my old paradigm and this new paradigm that I'm, like, see I'm I it. Do you believe in your old paradigm? No. You don't believe in your old paradigm? Not at all. No. Is that why you said earlier that felt like this was was a fraud? Well, I don't I I believe in it the past. Like, I believe in it last cohort. Okay. So you four point five. Was not out. Beginning of the last cohort. Yeah. Like, they won the last cohort. Was no 4.5. Yeah. There's always some things gonna to me. So do I believe in my old paradigm any like, today? No. No. I don't think it's good. But I also do I think they would get jobs? Yes. Do. So I know. It's complicated. I don't that's not how I think about my cohort, I guess. Yeah. No. I know you're In my heart, I have a sense that we are teaching the most valuable stuff. That I know how to teach. And right now, I'm like, no. Like, it's I'm teaching you literally worthless. Stuff. Yeah. Worthless stuff that isn't gonna get thrown away. And that, like, nobody will ever ever care about ever again. Which is, like, how does HTTP work? It's like I don't know, man. I think that's fake. And I think it's fake because it's if you exploded the box and that's why you learned, it was real. But if you never had to explode the box, then it was never real in the first place. I mean, my model of HTT is, like, I know the verbs. Yeah. I know how to, like, operationally use my tools to understand what's going on in network. Right. And how to write code to produce. Certain patterns of calls across the network. Yeah. That's I need to know. I need to know how, like, routing or packet switching works, whatever else. Right. That's academic. Right? You're talking about Yes. Stuff that I know is still worth working. Like, you're not talking about, like think I think that eighty percent of the stuff you know is not worth worth money anymore. That's what I'm saying. And that has to be true. Like, you like, I'm sure you believe that too. 80% of the stuff that you and I know is not worth learning anymore. It's that's sad for us, but I also don't it's not that sad. Like, I'm glad I know it. I think you and I will have some unique value because we know it. There's something Like, the only reason you and I would think that that stuff's worth knowing because you and I going to continue to code in a paradigm that cares about knowing those things, if that makes sense. Sense. But there will be a new paradigm. Let's just compare this for a second. Like, Yeah. To the world of four o'clock. Like, 2021 world. Right. In that world as a web developer, I could get away with not going a bunch of funnels stuff that I can And that's equivalent. Mean my my opinion is that that's equivalent. Yeah. But the thing is Like, you didn't even have to know, like, how the HDB library was implemented. Didn't even have to know how that c was compiled. But if I'm the engineer who writes, React, let's say Yeah. Or the engineer gets like, principal level, like, something that, like, now Netflix. Yeah. I do, in fact, need to know that stuff. Because probably you exploded the box and what to get there. Right. But I guess what I'm saying is Like, it's almost certain you didn't study it. School. And if you did study it in school, it's almost certain you don't remember it because of that. No. I'm not claiming that traditional education the way in the hall. Just claiming that there was an educational process that took place and the knowledge was valuable. Like, I did actually become more leveraged in the world because I don't think that's the right that's not the right claim. It's it's like what happens what happens is that the world is always infinitely complex. Sure. That's also true with software systems. They're infinitely complex. And, like, because we build increasingly high ladders of abstraction, what happens is, like, you want to be a junior engineer. Or a senior engineer, You need to be able to ship useful features. Yes. And then if you wanna be a principal engineer on some part of the project at Netflix, well, it kinda depends on the principal engineer. But, like it could be the case that what they did is they pulled you from fucking FFmpeg because you were the guy who implemented FFmpeg. And you did it in ruts whatever. Sure. But why did they need you It's because, like, Netflix had some, like, video streaming problem. Yeah. But they didn't know how to solve it any other way. Sure. And they were like, okay. Well, let's just, like, grab the guy from. So it's outcomes again. I think it's outcome. Yeah. My point is, like, I don't think Netflix is like, I wonder who we should promote. Like, it the guy with FFFM technology? Like, I don't think they would hire that guy ever in a million years. He's a nerd. It's mistaking the It's it's mistaking something that's a proxy for something that you care about for the actual thing. Yeah. So saying avoid all proxies. Like, what scares me is, like, what if that problem never comes up? And and, of course, it won't. Like, 90% of the time, Netflix will never have that problem. Isn't this kind of the opposite of what like, Daniel's teaching us about the words? Like, the the question I mean, this is a different curriculum. It's different educational projects. Right. But, like, in terms of developing a problem solver or a person, Yeah. You're there's a, like, world of activities where it may develop as a person, and not. Those activities God. If the size, the effect For the market, it looks the same. Works. You produce a certain kind of figure or a certain kind of engineer. That that never applies that knowledge, but is carried with them the imprint of that knowledge. But that's also true of, like, reading middleware. March. Should we have our students read middle March, or should we have them employ HDP? I am not gonna, like, die. I'm not gonna defend this philosophy of education. I'm not I to be clear, I don't have a stance. Like, I haven't decided. You have a question mark of, like, what is my flaw? I'm confident. I'm confident with 100% certainty. My current philosophy is bad. What I don't know is what the good philosophy is. Like, yes, these are the right questions. I identified all three of these things. Why did I identify them? I said that all three of them are important. You can't skip any of them. You need all three. But I think there's an order I think the order goes from this side to this side. Yeah. I agree with you. And I also think that how you go down this stack is also a skill. Like, there's actually this thing. It is a loop. Yeah. It's a loop. It's actually not like a it's not linear. Like, the metacognition or, like, self learning or whatever? Right. Using car to learn. I think that's yeah. That's a lot of what we're gonna teach. In this bucket that is not just about production. It's like learn and evaluate quality. Like like, let me propose something to you as a thought experiment. It's not real. But the thought experiment is like imagine that in week three, like, everyone applauded in week one and week two. And we had somehow, like, designed a curriculum that, like, fully got all their workflows and all their pipelines up such a point that our week three project is isometric New York City. Like, you're implementing the full pipeline start to finish. Now realistically, like, this is just not possible to be. Week. It's it's Well, there's There's too many, like There's, like, a paragraph in the blog post which covers up the entire process of him, like, knowing how to fine tune a model. Right. Exactly. So it's, like, not getting somebody to teach. But Yeah. That that's why this is a hard thought. Experiment. But it's like imagining that that is the kind of project we were, like, you're expected to do this and to learn how to do every subpart of it. And you have to do it fairly quickly. And you can learn from this guy who who's done it. Before. My point is, like, would they not run into, like, all the fine tuning problem? Like, would they not just run into every problem and then have to open the box? How are you gonna see like, you're just gonna, what, prompt Claude to fine tune your model? Yeah. That's interesting. Are we just gonna, like, prompt, like, the grit? Are you just gonna, like, prompt your way to this tool that lets you select these tiles? Like someone an ambitious enough problem, that forces them to learn how open and recompose boxes. Right. Like, put them on a trajectory where they're Yeah. It's like practicing problems that are not one shot at all. Impossible to be one shot. Right. You conceivably. Because that's the only way you're doing it for And then that's the curriculum. The curriculum is sort of like, what we have done is we've designed projects that are impossible launch out. A quad. You will never get Claude. Yeah. Ivan likes that shirt for some reason. I should just throw it. Kinda fishy. It's like, you just can't do it. Yeah. And and not not only that, but you're not gonna be able five code your way to it either. You're not gonna be able to slap code your way to it. Like, these projects are truly difficult. They're they they involve pipelines. They involve systems. They involve dev tools. They involve testing. Like, you will need every part of an engineering toolkit. To build something that's ambitious. And you will learn how to build it. Because Claude lets you. Like, this is the power of Claude. This is what Claude allows us to do. But it does mean, like, you will have to open boxes at a rate. That you've you know, never done before. And you're gonna have to, like, really dig into stuff that you've never dug into before. It's like that kind of thing. Okay. That feels like a really like the ambition, I guess. At least. My question is, like, someone could do this at home. Let's just do a thought experiment. Someone can do this at home. Assuming they actually do it. Sure. I'm not saying they can't. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Like, just start with apartments. They're sitting at home. They're like, I'm gonna recreate asymmetric New York. Yeah. What do you add until you get to, the full value of Fractal Tech? Like, start adding things. Daily journaling, Okay. Coaching. I give a coach. Anyhow you're stuck. You just, like, call Lily, an experienced engineer over, who's like, oh, interesting. Interesting. Let's think about this. Let's draw these different parts of system. Like, what are your dev tools? Let's help you get introspection. Like, how would that person even start That's there was one thing we're adding. Like, how do you even like, you're sitting down at your table. You're trying to build as much New York. Like, what the the fuck do you do? What is the first step? Yeah. Like, you're adding a framework by which you use claw to approach. Problems that seem too impossible and too large to tackle. K. Like a meta you're adding some kind of meta framework. Here. Also, you're gonna memorize, like, client server model, You're gonna memorize there's, like, a bunch of things you're gonna memorize. So your mind is just gonna have a bunch of stuff in No. But if you just sat down at home and did the isometric New York thing, there's a bunch of things that you'd like not learn. But that are good like, just generally good boxes to have. A pre unpacked. Right. We're like, okay. You don't need to, like, pre unpack every box. But, like, there's a few that I can just give you as freebies. It's like, yay yay yay. Like, you might be good. Report through free. Yeah. It might be good to know what computer architecture is. Might be good to know what the fuck a shader is, like, just so you know. Might be good to know, like, what the hell I'm training pipe pipeline is. Just have that memorized. Like, how what is the pipeline by which modern LLM is trained? K. That way, you can talk about it intelligently at the end of or something like that. Okay. So giving people lots of I don't know. Stuff like that. Like, giving people boxes. Free open boxes. Yeah. Free open boxes. That's true. Journaling, coaching, Obviously, like, a community, friends, Yeah. I mean, I actually think I mean, this stuff is all baked in. This point. So I'm actually curious, like, from the social aspect of it, just like the rapport building, like, her her hearing of It's, like, pretty important. People are I think people love that. Yeah. But how much of that is something What happens, like, automatically? That's not something that You kinda have to I mean, we do, like we we go out for drinks. And stuff. Yeah. But assuming you do that, it happens Preopen boxes and skills and do think skills would be good. Three open boxes and box covers. Box Because this is basically covering, like, material, like, lecture material. And it's covering life. How do you learn effectively? Yeah. Do you evaluate quality? Do you guys whatever? Right. Like, one thought I have also is, like, you're an engineering manager. Imagine you just got 20 interns. And now you gotta run the internship program for them. Like, what are you doing? Like, you your goal is to get them up speed because in twelve weeks, you got a long internship program. Like, you have full time weeks for twelve weeks but in twelve weeks, every single one of these people is going off into your company. Producing production code. Code, all of them. Then you can be productive. What's tricky about that is the thing that they were it's it's a lot easier to scope that because I'm like, my company has this code base. Yeah. Has this business problem, these shapes of problems. Right? I know all kinds of things come up. Yeah. I can pretty easily think about where in that landscape that in turn would, like, slot in and be able to do this. Like, what are company's co base is, like, fairly bog standard. For start ups. Right? Yeah. But there's some, like, I I need more, like, the domains. Yeah. And the patterns. And, like, systems I wanted to learn about, like, actual implementations of certain things that I've You would just train them directly on the phone base. Base? I think so. And I would give them projects that increase in scope the context of my code base so that they take a more and more ambitious scope. Yeah. And those projects can only succeed if they succeed in understanding what's in there and also have all these general boxes. Yeah. Tricky thing here is that, like, we're injecting people into a blank box. There's no scaffolding of, like, a running business. Yeah. Or an existing code base. Right. So there's these 20 problems that you're covering up with. That serve that function. Right? Or, like, they can work with their own projects, for instance. So I think the big question is like, what are we actually gonna play for that? As outcomes? Yeah. Because isometric New York I don't know, 20 people, like, you realistically be able to get them all out of real on real products in your code base? How many problems do you have in your code base? It's really not 20. I have, like, enough. I can definitely use 20 people. Really? Yeah. A 100%. Wow. That's crazy. Mean, they might all be, like, if you're just talking about free labor, I know I'm Yeah. If you're talking about making them, like, best energy I mean, it's not free labor. They need to be good. Like, you're gonna you're gonna pay them. Sure. You're paying them for the internship. You know? There's real opportunity cost here. That's the right way to think about it. Right? Same same case here where, like, they're paying us, but we're teachers. So it's as if you're paying them. But, again, it's like, the tricky thing is I am so familiar with this landscape. It's a complex machine. That I can think about how to put them into. Yeah. Much is it missing here? We're doing something much harder, which is that, like, we are aiding at any human company. That's not true. We can target. Like, we can obviously target, like, a niche or whatever. Like, in the past, we were teaching NextJS. Like, we can we can be like what we care like, you're getting jobs at SAS. You know? Like, this is this is the stat SaaS side. It's just I just don't even know know if that's helpful. You know? I don't even know if it's what like, that's not really what people hire on. What do what do people even hire on now? Nothing. Like, I think there's no principle by which people hire anymore. I know. I'm losing mean, what happened this last I feel like what happened this last cohort is that everyone just went into interviews, and then all the inter interviews were, like take home. That they liked it. With the app. And then they got the jobs? Yeah. I mean, the ones who got the jobs. Not every student is placed yet. It's only been I don't know, whatever. But What percentage is the only how many seats have been placed How many seats have jobs now? I should know exactly, but I think it's, like nine students have jobs. And 13 students remain. Something like that. It's pretty normal, though. Though. It's normal as far as, like, recent cohorts? It's really Not just recent. Like, from the very beginning. Like, all of them? Yeah. You know, like, somebody is in the as they graduate. That's crazy. When would you expect the rest of those people? Sometime in the next five months. Probably, it takes some longer. Six months. You're not pitching this anymore. It's like No. In this part of the job placement services. Like, we meet with them every week. Six months. Oh, so they're still around. They're still in a weekly meeting. Got it. Who does that right now? I do David does. But that's all. The way they get the job is that the process falls spearfishing, but that's, like, kind of point. I'm kind of wondering, like, Like, for what is worth, this kind of thinking, you should separate from the job market. Like, companies aren't thinking like this. Yet. We're not we're not there yet. Sure. But Companies need talent that understands Claude. But we need to get ahead of those companies. Because right now, there's, like, hiring mandates to, like, hire hire claud engineers as far as I tell. Like, people are getting increasingly many take homes. They're increasingly adding AI in into their into their coding process. I would be encountering a world which did not cut up to me. In the hearing process. I think the world is, like, a casual I don't think if you're going to enterprises, it's totally different. Figured out sending No. Almost nobody. Okay. If I imagine that like, this is twelve weeks long. Right? Yeah. Okay. So it's three months and then six months, basically. Or two life cycles. Yeah. The three months is like the runway. Right? Yep. You want someone to be, like, flying the plane at the end? And flying the plane like, to me, if I mentored one of our students, some through the program and some like, three months. After the program end. They didn't have a job. And I was like, was this successful for them? Yeah. The way that I would evaluate that is, like, are they continuing to build our Yeah. And produce evidence to the world that they can do those things. Yeah. On their own. Yeah. Like, we gave them the medicine. Yeah. Yeah. I I agree with it. Yes. Because if they're still doing that move, they're fine. They're gonna get better. Just a matter of time. If that loop has stopped completely Yep. Then they're probably dead. Yeah. So that actually, I feel like, is the worst of her. Yep. Like, we're training people who within three months will sit down at their computer every day, and produce products they're excited about and we'll show it to the world. Mhmm. That last part, by the way, is also I know how much of a skill or habit that you developed. People throughout the cohort. Like Yeah. I kind of wanna be, like, you should be producing this kind of writing, like, isometric work. I literally think we should produce that every week. I was thinking of structuring the program around this cohort. Around retros? Written retros. Like, that's So, like, a blog post has a Yeah. I mean, now they're clearly, like, a retro. Right. He was like, here's Here's what I did. Here's what I did. Not like a blog in the sense of anything. It's like, this is specifically a technical one. Post. And Right. And I was thinking I was thinking about literally rewriting the entire program to be this. You like, impossible to one shot Cloud Code task. That you retro at the end of the week. And Yeah. And you're like, here's every piece of it. Here's how I figured it out. This is what I learned as an engineer. That's so much more interesting. Right. Because everyone knows like, I mean, I think because, like, nobody knows how to use Claude. People people aren't actually out there in the arena. If you're out there in the arena in Claude and you publish that every week. Well, like, woah. Shit. Yeah. Plus, you can write coherently about it. Which means that you understand. Yep. I think Well, then you have to open up you have to open up the boxes because you're writing them. So now you have a second reason to have to go, like, model. It is, like, it's a story effect to why you value people's understanding. Exactly. The the final reasons that this is good is we're evaluating the student by the exact same means that the market will evaluate. So we can basically evaluate their marketable artifact rather than needing to evaluate some, like, arbitrary in between thing, like how they've shown test. A thousand percent. Okay. I'm fully on board with what saying. Okay. So this is this is right. Retro driven development. Yeah. Or it's just to be a good professional Yep. It's how to be how to get anything done? Like, do Okay. So I think some part of this question is, like, what targets you're given to pay? I mean, clients believe that this is the same shape as the tardiness policy, Yeah. Same emotional shape. Is, like, you need to set your own standard for what you think is great work. And what you find compelling to put into the world. Yep. We're gonna hold you to your life. Yeah. But here's how to do it. But, like, here here's a 10 Sure. Yeah. Here's a framework for thinking of a demo. Or retros. Yeah. And yeah, What I'm about to think about, we've got a lot of pieces here. Yeah. The weekly loop, it sounds like that you're envisioning is, like, retro. Plus demoable project. Ideally, published demo project. Yeah. And we evaluate that. The other one we talked about was, Blue Book evaluation on the boxes we can shoot off the top of your head. Yep. Another one is, like, daily ZIP code Yep. Practice. Yep. I feel like if you actually model the curriculum as all these loops Yeah. I I actually Did you do that? I've done this before. Does it does it work? Is it a helpful I didn't do it. Like, I didn't it turns out the short answer is yes. Like, we will do that, and it will Okay. That's the right because it's it's about feedback. Loops. Yeah. The reason it didn't work is because I wasn't running the last cohort. Paris and David were. So I, like, came up with framework of Loops. And they were like, that's not where we're doing. So Did they just sign up here because it was a good idea? I think it just their idea. Okay. Just, like, classic, like, communication barrier. I don't wanna, like, read about the wheelier too and, like, I think this is, like we I'm literally telling you that we have to reinvent wheel effect. My intuition is that the basic design problem of the entire curriculum, like, everything we're doing can be stayed as identifying the loops and then Make them better. Make them spin. Yeah. Make them yeah. Right. And, actually, we just talked about, like, three months out from the program end Yeah. Where someone's like, spinning on their own loops. Right. Like, make them run on their own. Yeah. So we started the program. We're pushing them, Right. By the middle of program, they should be, like, kind of running movements on Yeah. It should just be off doing this. All of the subproblems of that are just, like, under that. I think that's, like, the top level design question that we should point. Think on. Yep. So you've identified a few loops and a few methods. Yep. Than this fucking shit. Where it's like, goddamn. I wanna I wanna think about I wanna tell you to build a TikTok story here, but then look at your code. I want you to create a fun crazy ass project, and then I wanna, like, jam on it with you. Yeah. And every single other boot campground in the market is gonna do that. So, like, why didn't they do that? Yeah. Those are just for the only the the problem we experience is that they needed to make a tic tac toe app. Like, I've already built that curriculum. What do you mean? Like, we feel If what we experience by running the cohort is that they're not ready for this kind of Like, they're just drowning in the open ended stuff. Yeah. I have all these products. Like, we'll just go we'll just we'll reverse course It's fine. Sure. So I agree that the loops like, what are the loops we need to the real question here Liam, is how do we, as the like, guides Yeah. Monitor all the loops. Because it's a lot of loops. It's, like, 20 by four loops. Or something. Right? Sure. So let's say there's a let's say there's a clawed loop. Or, like, we could call this, like, the retro. There's a retro loop. Yeah. There's which we can also call the demo loop. Like, maybe they'll both write a retro and then do a demo. Right. There's a journaling loop which is about, like, personal So retro loop, journaling loop, exam, like, studying loop. Is there another one? We could. Yeah. So there's, like, a least dose. And there's also, like, reading maybe. Which could could be the same. That's subset of Yeah. Like Sure. Yeah. Maybe maybe it's the subset of the journal. One. Maybe, like, journaling and reading go together. When you say journaling, is that just about, like, personal development? Yeah. It's about it's actually just about articulation. Of of thoughts and feelings. Like, like, yeah. What am I going through? What am I trying to say? What am I thinking? What am I feeling? Yeah. I I I think you would be surprised how different people come into the program with that skill. Like, some people very good at articulating themselves using written language, and some people, like, have not practiced. Yeah. And they just need to practice every day. Day. Anyway, so, like, let's say we have those loops Do we have some kind of automated system Do we have like David has a whole classroom management software. That we'll go over. Together as well. Yeah. I mean, can we can figure all that out. And but you think it it should be fine. Like, we'll just we'll just kind of create reminders or, like, whatever. Oh, yeah. Or, like, not even reminders. Like, maybe we'll have a a way of tracking it so that they have a portfolio. That, like, they have, like, a portfolio over time. That you can see inside the app Probably something like that. Yeah. We center instruments in that. Yeah. I'm not super like, I don't really care All that matters is because, basically, the the like, a straggler problem. Like, you just wanna make sure that people secretly not doing the loops. Oh, a thousand percent. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we have to believe that the loops in fact, because we don't control this part. Yeah. We control this part, we control this part. Part. Yeah. I mean, No. Right. I mean It's not don't have infinite points of feedback. Only the person has infinite points of feedback. Yes. We don't. Only have finite points of feedback. Like, the game for us is, like, how do we instrument this process into a way that one, the instrumentation actually points towards outcomes we care about. Yeah. If we're getting signal on whether people are moving, Yep. And two, don't instrument it in a way that's too expensive for us. Yep. Like, our time is expensive. Exactly. Our energy is expensive. We can't, like, scale that. Across. 20 people doing Yeah. You know, pair programming, for instance. Yeah. We can. So but from what you're saying, sounds like that is actually it sounds like the loop is really expensive and really tight at the beginning of the chord. Yeah. It gets longer and less expensive. Farther out you go. Yeah. Yeah. Through a process of Yeah. It's very I'm really not worried about it as long as we have a way to check-in basically. K. Like, I I do think the loops will run on their own. Yeah. But, occasionally, you'll still wanna look. Because, like, they'll be running, but they might be kind of like clot. Might just be like, hallucinating. Well, this is the this is the interesting thing. Like, the nature of the problem with Asians it's like a it's like will talk to you about an anthropist constitution. Yeah. It's just like This is Yeah. Obviously, this is where it ends up. Right? Yeah. Like, a special case that I outlined. It's a special case of ethics. In law. This is agent orchestration is a special case of, like, how do you do quality control management? And, like, coaching and you know, performance and stuff? Right. So, like, we're yeah. Like, these are these are all black boxes to some extent. We have to figure that out. Yeah. Yeah. Inspiring them is obviously really, really important. Yeah. Practice rep like, retros, gyms, developing team teamwork. There's actually a lot of stuff to be learned from some of the best coaches. There's some, like, cool things that good coaches Yeah. I think you're much from where we're starting, I think you're a much better position to do that kind of thing. I don't really believe in myself. When it comes to motivating people. Yeah. Sure. I think they're gonna like you. More, but I think they'll like me. And I think I have more powers than I believe. But I'm just saying, like, sure. Yeah. Anyway. This feels like a tractable design prompt, though. Yeah. I agree. So then, basically, what we wanna do is we want start coming up with like, for if if Like, for it it really is about these these impossible one shot projects. We shouldn't come up with, like, a list of them. We obviously can use cloud for it can, like, I didn't show him a list of examples. Which are benchmarks for how ambitious we expect you to be. Yeah. And, also, there are fallbacks in case someone just fails to come up with their own idea. Yeah. That's good enough. Yeah. But I prefer them to be benchmarks by which other people come up with their own bespoke thing that they intrinsically care about for some reason. Yeah. Like, a Nazi's crazy ass cell game. Cool. Is, like, the level I wish. Yeah. He was in here. Like, I was running November. He was running December. Right. Like, he was in here all hours every day. I saw him every time I came in He was like, possessed by that project. Yeah. Like, that's the disaster that would be the benchmark here, I think. So but everyone's getting different. I know. And I don't know how much people are gonna come with that sauce of, like, I can just come up with interesting cool, things that are meaningful in my life that would be pretty Yeah. So It's it's, like, less than you think, I'd say, because they're in a a lot of them are coming to learn. So you wanna this is where, like, preopened boxes. Preopened boxes is, like, really, really valuable. One of the things that you can give them Preopened boxes are prearranged boxes. Yep. Prearranged. Yeah. Like, Like, show this is Lego sets. You can you can call it, like, Lego sets. But it's like people really, really want to be given the, like, set of LEGOs and then be told, like, okay, assemble them. According to the instructions. Sure. And admittedly, that doesn't teach you Like, it also isn't the same as being creative. But teaches you a lot of stuff. Well, it also emotionally instills me the feeling like, okay. I'll do this. Yeah. Right? So we'll want a mix. We'll want a mix of, like, the thing I'm trying to get at with the the Impossible to one shot stuff, by the way, is it's about, like, it's about almost the the, like, the number of components. This system. Yeah. Whereas, like, I would like a system with many components. Yes. Although it's like it's like systems at scale. It's almost like single developers but systems at scale. And I don't actually want necessarily systems that are difficult. To create. So much as, like, it's just a big one. Or difficult to understand. So it's like the ideal system is actually a system that's easy to understand but has many components. Totally. And then you kinda have to build them one by one. Yeah. Because, obviously, you weren't as big as an agent. Horizon and plan Right. Stuff. And that's also important to understand. It's not just about complexity stealing. Yeah. About, like, these tools are you still You know, you actually kinda wanna start with one shot. Like, here's a thought. Oh, man. Fuck. So hard. It feels like one shot boxes. Yeah. It's almost like you wanna, like, you you can imagine receiving a PDF. Like, on page one, there's, like, a box and it's called, like, tic tac toe. Yes. And then your goal is, like, build tic tac toe. For the claw. Right. And then, like, evaluation at the bottom is, like, you have working tic tac toe. With Claude. In your browser. Yeah. And then flip to the next page. And then the next page is, like, tic tac toe with login. And then you, like like, you just you're, like, try to one shot it, if you want. You can go ahead and try. I won't be like Here's the way that we're modeling the system. Yeah. We're modeling it as, an off system and a tic tac toe system, and now there's a server because you have off. Like, the way we're modeling it is there's, a server, and there's a client. And there's an auth system that sits the server and the client, and there's a user Another user it's like, look, dude. The complexity just exploded. Yep. Because before you had a client side application, Yes. Very easy. Lived on the client. Yeah. Now we have this convenient server client diagram, and look how much shit is on the server, and look how much extra shit's on the client. Dude. You have a concept of a user, you know, so you have all these extra concepts. And then we're like, you think you're gonna get Claude to do this with the same prompt? Like, good luck. Maybe you can do it. Be a thing. It's gonna spin. It's gonna run out of context. You're gonna have to restart it. Then it's maybe gonna get confused. Yeah. And then we go to the next page, and we're like, okay. Real time tic tac toe with lobbying. With lobbying and users. And a database with a history of your games. Yes. And then we draw that as a system. That's really awesome. And so it's almost like you want you want this, like, like Legos. It is like Legos. It's like you're you're you you go to quad, and you have it construct, like, one component at a time or something that. Like that. Yeah. This is this is so great. Yeah, it's like it's it's a gradual ramp up to, this. Right. Pushing them to open boxes. Yeah. Also, I think you can layer in all these interesting things like one, you have to learn the skill of like, you can them a slash commit, but it's like, it will write you a plan. How it's gonna do it. Yeah. And you can just be like, maybe this is Jack Henry for your liking, but, like, read the Mhmm. It make sense to you? Yeah. If you wanna just ignore the plan and say, do the plan, Claude, Yeah. Okay. But, like, it didn't work. Reflect on that. Yep. And so that's, I guess, in the start, like, there's there's all these things about, like, how do you actually steer Yeah. There's steering. Steering is the skill. Right? Another kind of remix of this that also Joffeila has talked about is, like, he does this thing where he gets the agent to write him. Steering. Steering. Yes. Yeah. So steering this is actually kind of a limp. Right? So there's, like, steering wheel with steering and playing. There's, like, implementation. Getting unstuck. Joffrey's, like, one of his demos now is like he will have corn bite himself. Right? Sorry. Claude will write him, Yeah. Plan for how thinks he should implement a feature. Yep. Then Jonathan will follow on with the plan, manually coding it. Yeah. And as he does that, he abides the knowledge of what's happening. Right. Right? And he feels the system. Right. So reverse together. There's a reverse theory. Claude tells you what to do. Right. And then that way you get a feeling of where Claude of what Claude thinks. Right. And you and you get the plan at least as well as you can get. For someone who has not Right. Done that. Right? Yeah. Maybe that's, like, a limitation. We say, hey. You need to try it out this way. Right. For some percentage of the time. So I don't know. I just think there's interesting stuff you can do there around, like, planning and also digesting the knowledge of what you're doing. Maybe some of it is too academically biased. Other thing that I'd love to do is, like, okay. You've got a working solution. Let's do a mini dissertation. Like, you need to explain it to me. Yeah. Like you and me. Baby doesn't scale. But, like, or maybe climb quizzes you on it. Yeah. There's some way in which you have to evaluate your own understanding. Of what freezed. Right. And the value of the quality of it. Yeah. The those are the those are the loops that often I found to be too expensive. So like, in other words, the retro kind of covers that. Right? It's, like, basically, what you do is you use this retro at the end project where you kind of say all the things you did and all the things you've learned. Right. And then we're gonna read those. But if you add too much basically, like, you have to how do you describe this? People will self evaluate. Or they will not. Like, either they are either they are courageous or they are cowards. Yeah. If they're cowards, there's nothing we can do for them outside of, like, confronting their cowardice. Sure. Until they're courageous. But you want a forcing function for them to Yeah. You you do wanna teach them. Like, you wanna you wanna call out to them. Like, the way, you should be self evaluating. Like, and what seems like we're already doing that. You know way that we're structuring the program is just like that. But and you'll have more chances to to teach this than you expect, but, also, you just wanna be careful about putting it into the structure the program. I found. Because if you try to put too much fuzzy stuff into the structure, then not able to keep up with it. It's like it's too much. Right. You don't you have no clear value. You no clear, like, the loop isn't clear enough. You need, like, really, really crisp loops, basically. Right. This is great, though. This, like, this how do you build this PDF How do you build this, like, system PDF? We don't that almost reminds me is itself a plot problem of the scale of isometric New York kind of. Right? It's like What's the norm? The problem is we want them we want a bunch of system diarrhea. To be produced that are, like, legible. Yeah. For, like, various increasingly complex aversions of a system like tic tac toe. Tic tac toe in 20 ways or whatever. Yeah. And right now, I have no way to produce those diagrams except drawing them by hand. Hand Yes. Which is not a feasible way for me to Right. Do this entire curriculum. Totally. So instead, I need a pipeline that is gonna produce diagrams from like, conversations like this. Wait. Sorry. What are the diagrams for? What are the diagrams for? Like, No. The diagrams are diagrams like, basically, you have a diagram of kick that toe. On the client, and you have a diagram of tic tac toe with auth. Oh, sure. These are server client diagrams. Yes. And you can obviously have a lot of diagrams of these different systems. But the point is just, like, we want to give people visual ways or symbolic. We wanna give people more symbolic ways To Visual and symbolic ways. To understand. Seeing the seeing what complexity does to a system. Seeing what, like, seeing what more components means. Dude, yeah. Whole Like, when you add off what does it actually mean? It's like, look at all this complexity. Can literally just can start trying to figure And so if we can make build a pipeline, helps us look at arbitrary systems Yeah. Then what we can do is we can first build these systems, and we can be like, here's tic tac toe one, tic tac toe two, tic tac toe three, can move one through 10 We can be like, your goal is to build tic tac tac toes one through 10 with Claude. Right. Use any prompting method you want. But, like, here's how you know it works. Here's how you will know it works. Because, like, have a clot we'll give you a prompt for Claude to test or something. No. That's yeah. Exactly. I I think basically, one of our challenges here is gonna be, like, our, like, personal, and it's on the bookshelf, like, our library of prompts and skills and stuff. Yeah. Which our students should be given that are, like, the best like, metagognitive, like, best reflect back to your learning Yeah. Things? Anything from, like, the whole thing where it, like, quizzes you on your PR to instructs you how to write it by hand to what you're saying, which is basically like, here is a prompt for you. You just do, like, slash diagram. Yeah. Pointing at your code base. It produces the diagram for you. Right. Like, you get to X-ray your code base. Yeah. Like, aids to understanding. And by the way, oh, this is just a markdown file. Yeah. You should also think about how to develop your own needs to understanding. Yeah. Because you now have a programmable intelligence that can produce the answer to whatever question you pose to it, but, like, you need to think about what questions are gonna be most helpful for you to bootstrap your own Yeah. Point to what you're doing. Yeah. We'll give you prebuilt examples of that. Well, and this is the thing I was saying about about you you were talking about prearranged. Boxes. Right? Yeah. This is what I'm saying. It's like Yeah. You're basically what what am I doing when I give you tic tac toe? I'm telling you that tic tac toe is a system with a a single lock. Box. Right. It's a client app. And then that client app actually is split into two major boxes. It's the game engine the rendering. Engine. So you have a game system and a rendering And like, that's what and and you like, one thing they'll start to understand is that there's, like, an arbitrary number of ways of cutting out these boxes. Yes. And conceiving of them. Right. But that, like, that is the check like, that's the new task. The new skill is, like, can you conceive of a system? Can they become real to you? Right. Is there such a thing as Or in you have taste. Right. If you have, like, discernment of what's good and what's bad. But then when I switched to tic tac toe with both, and users, it's sort of like woah. Holy shit. Actually, Tac Toe is the system with all these boxes. And, like, look. The off box and look at the server box and look at the client box. And they might start to get freaked out, but it's like, okay. Well, now that's an opportunity to start forcing open the boxes. That will go faster I mean, it's an it's an experiment, but, like, I suspect it might go faster. Than if you just had them run at it and just clawed. Without these, like, diagrams. To help them construct and conceive of these because the worst place to be is you're just in a loop. Right. Where you And you have hole. Yeah. You have no idea what's going on. On. Right. And you're at the mercy of just, like, you're playing dice in that way. Yeah. You're just gambling. Yeah. You're gambling the tokens. No No gambling. No gambling. Actually, being on day one seat, No gambling. Seriously. Yeah. Yeah. I get also, this is literally like I think this is People. Yeah. I get it. Like, I think this is actually Like, Yeah. It's like gambling where the outcome is not money. It's code. Right. And if that really hits your shit, then you're gonna be like, in quad all day and night. Yeah. So yeah, Okay. Well, maybe my goal then will be to go work on this go work on this system for developing increasingly complex Like, developing ways of conceiving of increasingly complex. Systems. Because I can build something like that, with Claude, I can I can imagine a pedagogy that makes sense? Sense. Because one of the problems here is, like, if you try to assign these impossible to one shot paths, to students, and they can't conceive of them, they're gonna they're gonna build the library tools for understanding. Yeah. They're gonna get freaked out. Totally. Okay. Is that, like you're saying, like, that's priority number one for you? Because I disagree. What's priority number one? I think priority number one is our core design Like, we need a map of these loops. Yeah. We need to be confident that we're instrumenting them in a in a, like, sorry. At an expense we can afford, a cost we can afford. Yeah. Like, in a way that actually drives quality. For people. Yeah. One way we will drive this loop is the thing you're talking about. Right? Yeah. That's below this. I think that's, like, an interpretation you told. Us. Okay. So I think we need to firm this up. Like, that's the thing that we actually And you want and, like, what is the what is the I would that you like, what's the artifact you want that represents this? I don't know what form it takes, but it's something like here is list of cadences like, buckets, daily, weekly, Mhmm. I don't know what else. Monthly. I guess when we have three months. So I do it daily and weekly. We identify all the loops. Mhmm. Or actually, maybe we identify, like, what do you care about sampling and pushing people? To improve on. Right? Like, that's the Yeah. We should give them a rubric or self rating. Also, I guess. Like, if we really deeply care about every one of these loops, we obviously need to evaluate framework. That we can that we can start to share with the students so that they can self evaluate. Yes. And one of the questions I consistently get from students is something along the lines of, like, how do I know something's good? I guess is a rubric. That's what a rubric is. Yeah. That can be an option too. Uh-huh. Okay. So I think we need that. Structure of our imagining. I don't think we need to, like, finalize the loops. I think it should explode them. Yeah. Like, divergently think about all that all all of them should be. Yeah. And then start to, like, wheel them down and be like, okay. Here are the we need four. Yeah. Maybe those are the four we're confident in. Let's be confident in what those are. Yeah. And then work backwards from there to tactfully, like, what are we doing? Week over week? Yeah. Like, we've got a week Like, is the right because we believe so much in, like, clot and stuff like that, is the right artifact here just, a markdown file that I didn't identifies these? These loops? That way, Yeah. I can appreciate it. Readable by Glock. You should share the repo. Yeah. Repet it. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty I mean, that's perfect. So by trying to add my And I was like, yes. Didn't know that was supposed to a problem. They're like, it's not, but it did break. Everything. Okay. This is amazing. I know. This is so much fun. It's way better. If this is what I'm doing, this is so fucking incredible. This is the job. Except it's more fun than this because right now it's the most stressful. Time because it's like Right. You're you got I also wanna say now we have, like, a lot of shit to do, whereas eventually, we'll be, like, just opportunity. But, actually, underneath all the shit we have to do is, like, a chance to put into practice, like, incredibly interesting questions about Well, the other thing is, like, imagine if we published any of this. Like, we're literally we're sitting on gold here, and our job our job is come up with a new paradigm of software engineering. And right now, everyone is doing like, that's the that's the task of civilization. So we're out here at the frontier actually doing, like, the most important work. That's great. So anyway. It's a loop. This we'll first okay. 1,000? It's like six. Okay. Six per I need to go have dinner with my parents. That makes sense. I between now and like, here's the full list of everything that's going about. Yeah. And helping Joss move. Yeah. I'm hoping you're a find a place to live. Yeah. Or almost at the end of that process. We gotta come on a tour, and I was like, I'm like, the street easy wizard. I'm so good at apartment searching. Yeah. So I was just like, found a good apartment. Nice. We need to, like, sell a bunch of shit. Like, my life is gonna be, like, a little bird of, like, 20% of my time just needs to go to, like, Yeah. Figuring all this shit out. Does it need to be sold? Like, okay. Like, how many Logistically, like, whatever. Right? Like, just telling you that there's, like, a floor of, like, or other yeah. Whatever. There's, a box of time that's, like, in my personal time, I need to take up with Yeah. I agree. Moving out of my apartment and like, transitioning where I'm at, which is, like, this strange platonic heartbreak. Relationship to, like, a fully separated thing. Yep. And then over the next two weeks, I need to wind out of my job. Yep. Do want me to do a good job of So this is great. Because, like I get the sense that you have a lot more to hang your coat on. Yeah. Than you had when we started this session. Yeah. This is useful. And you can, like, fill things in. Yep. Fill in boxes now. Yep. But I'm not sure that I can do a ton of that work with you. Yeah. In the next two weeks. To fill it in. Yeah. That makes sense. There's a certain budget of time that I can give to that, but I'm not exactly sure what the budget is. Yep. So, yeah, I think we should just basically figure out, like, within the next two weeks, we can, like, put on the calendar, like, blocks of time when I'm, like, coming here. Yeah. Time blocks, like, two hours, and we just do whatever you think is the most important thing for us to do. Yeah. Outside of that time, probably just be, like, fully focused on winding down my job and moving and stuff. Yeah. That makes sense. That seem more I think we should just do the inverse thing. Actually, which is more like I'm not necessarily expecting time Well, this isn't like I'm Yeah. Trying to, like Oh, you're saying, like, what is the minimum amount of time you need to time? Box? No. No. I'm just saying, like, this is the way that I feel like I can actually manage this right now. Yeah. Is, like, if the like, this isn't about, like, I wanna meet your expectations. Yeah. It's like, I think that what I can do is make a argument of, like, putting several chalky Yeah. Sessions on the calendar Okay. We meet up, like, daily here. Yeah. Talk through this stuff in the evening. Something. Yeah. Or, like, whenever the time works. Yeah. Basically, anytime that works for you, that you wanna do it, it's probably all gonna be synchronous is what I'm saying. Yeah. I don't think I can go off and do something asynchronously. That makes sense. Yeah. You already have a lot of other today. I mean, mainly, I do all my work. Sync in this office anyway. Yeah. But, like, sink. You know what's crazy? A little bit like Please make sure that file gets saved. The granola? Yeah. Yeah. I will. This isn't, like, I'm just realizing, like, the way we can work together is, like, we can sit here and talk like, two hours. Yeah. Technically, the way we can just we can just even sit side by side and, like, claw it apart also. Put it into a markdown file and then just, like, start to pull artifacts out of that. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. I'll make sure the transcript goes no marked on file in the mono repo as well. Granola has the full transcript. Right? Not just, like, the voice recording. Or I guess if it does have the voice recording, it just I think it does have the voice Yeah. Figuring out pipelines, Like, one thing that I want to do with you that's, like, a high priority is figuring out pipelines to turn conversations like this into work products. Because there's, like, various kinds of work product. But for instance, turning, like, a transcript into a markdown file and making sure that that like, we I shouldn't have to like, I shouldn't have to press any buttons to do that. Like It's your interest. It should just be it should be a solved problem. And there's a lot of other like, every time that we come up with a new curriculum, pattern in a transcript, there's some sense in which, like, something like a curriculum proposal should be being made by Claude. That's like, hey. It sounds like you want to do like, these things. Yeah. Like, there's a pull request, actually. Against your mono repo. And it's like, here's here are all the changes to all the different weeks where I I'll be doing, I know, whatever. So I feel like we can build all that. It won't even be that hard. It's not something many prompts. This is gonna be the this is gonna sick. It's gonna be sick. Only fucking shit. Yeah. It's like the 10 times better bacteria. Yeah. It's so Okay. Are you still using something's kinda rude for me. What? Because my life kinda feels like a fever dream right now. Yeah. Just need you to let me be high and be like, Liam, I'm giving you 10% of my company, and I'm paying you a $100,000. Yeah. Starting in two weeks Okay. To work with me as a co founder. Yeah. Just say that to you. Okay. Liam. I'm gonna give you a $100,000 and 10% of the company and gonna build this company, and you're gonna be my cofounder, and we're gonna rich. Cool. Mostly selling this boot camp. Yes. And then after that, making software. Cool. Great. But there's some chance that six months from now, all gone. It's all gone? Yeah. Because we could fail catastrophically? And But I don't predict that. Over that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I I don't think like, basically, the way that I'm modeling it is I think that this kind of thing is what I want my life to be like. Like my career. This kind of thing. Right. And I just I like, the last person I could do it was Jake, and now there's somebody else to do And, like, the person I would most like to do it with is you. Yeah. Which is why I wanna do that cofounder. But I also am scared and uncertain of how fast everything's changing in the world. Yeah. And I'm scared that, like, our company will become increasingly irrelevant. The more if we don't, like, execute correctly, Yes. But when I have conversations like this, then I'm like, oh, shit. We're on to something. Yeah. We're actually ahead of the curve. Yeah. Things are gonna be great. Yeah. So my feeling in terms of, like, fever dream, mistake Is it a good idea or not? It's just along the lines of, like, I think if we keep doing this, like, we die. Easy. It's more like I need to from, like, a derealized state to a realized state. Oh, I see. You know what mean? Like, so much is changing that I'm like I think if you just, like, do a couple yeah. You just do a couple sleeps it'll be okay. But, like Yeah. If you think about it from my perspective, the thing that it's like it just obviously makes sense. Because I think that you I think that you will work hard with me in every day. I don't know. We're just hanging out at the office at seven. And you your start date is two weeks from now. What's crazy to me is, like, early Because that kind of thing energizes both of us. So we'll be able to just, like, do this full time, and that just seems great. Right. And so it really it's almost like the the completion of a loop of, like, oh, the shit that we used to do in the mornings Right. Before your job, we can now just do full time. Right. With the caveat that we need to, like, Yeah. It's we need to help we need to go help these people. Well, it's good to have ground truths. Because we're not just, like, iterating on the legal panel, like, whatever. Are you are you giving someone a job? Like, we did this much. You need to create using Fogger's current. I'll leave a panel that she uses the button color. Okay. But that's wait. Do you do you actually need to see your parents? Yeah. Okay.
