# The Fractal Job Hunt Strategy

This document describes Fractal’s official job hunt strategy.

It explains:

- Why the default “spray and pray” application approach almost never works for you.
- What actually causes people to get interviews and offers.
- How your story, portfolio, spearfishing, and networking fit together into one system.
- How to think about your search as a sales pipeline and diagnose where it is breaking.

If something is going wrong in your job hunt, you should be able to come back here, find the step you are under-executing, and fix that. The strategy works. If it is not working for you, the problem is almost always execution, not the model.

## Why the Default Strategy Fails

The default plan most juniors have in their head looks like this:

1. Learn to code.
2. Write a resume.
3. Apply to hundreds of jobs on LinkedIn.
4. Eventually someone calls back.

For most early-career engineers without elite credentials or brand-name experience, this plan simply does not function anymore. The bottleneck is not “effort.” The bottleneck is that the channel you are using cannot carry enough signal about you.

### The Resume Blender

When you click “Easy Apply” on a typical posting, something like this happens:

- The company receives hundreds or thousands of applications.
- No human being reads that entire pile.
- A system filters resumes by keywords, titles, schools, and brand names until the list is small enough for a recruiter to skim.
- The recruiter spends a few seconds per resume on that filtered subset and forwards a smaller list to the hiring manager.

Every extra applicant makes it easier for the company to be more aggressive with those filters. If there are 10,000 applicants, they can throw away 9,500 and still have far too many to interview.

If you do not look obviously excellent on paper compared to that entire pile, you disappear before a human ever sees your name. Not because anyone hates you personally, but because the process is built to eliminate almost everyone as quickly as possible.

### Why You Can't "Stand Out"

For early-career engineers, this environment has a few brutal properties:

- Your resume looks similar to thousands of others. Same generic titles. Same “junior projects.” Same vague bullet points.
- You often lack the standard “strong signals”: years of professional experience, well-known companies, or elite degrees.
- The people tuning the filters do not know you and do not have time to investigate. They only see the text on the page.

From the company’s point of view, the risk is clear:

- Many junior applicants cannot actually do the work.
- The resume alone is a very weak way to tell who is real and who is not.
- When in doubt, it is safer to use crude filters (school, brand, certain titles) than to spend hours investigating unknowns.

If your resume is not in roughly the top few percent of that pile on paper, the system is perfectly comfortable filtering you out. You are not competing with the 10 people you feel “similar” to. You are competing with thousands of candidates, some of whom have significantly stronger traditional signals than you do.

You can and should improve your resume. We have plenty of advice on resumes and how to use them [here](../resume/README.md). But you should not build your job hunt around a channel where:

- Your structural disadvantages (little experience, non-fancy education, career change) matter most.
- You are relying on a one-page document to carry your entire story through a noisy, automated filter.

For most of you, the online application channel is not “low probability but worth trying.” It is a near-zero-probability channel that eats time and emotional energy you could spend on things that actually move the needle.

If you earnestly feel that your resume is in the top 5% of people who apply for the role (e.g. past experience at a Fortune 500, STEM degree from an elite university), then spending ~30 minutes a day applying to high-quality roles online might still be useful for you. If that's not you, you should probably skip this entirely.

## How People Actually Get Jobs

If the resume blender is not going to save you, what does?

In practice, successful hires for people like you almost always start the same way:

> A real human at the company receives a specific, high-context reason to pay attention to you.

That “reason to pay attention” is the introduction. At Fractal, we care about three main kinds of introductions:

1. Warm introductions.
2. Networking encounters.
3. [Spearfishing](./spearfishing.md).

All of them do the same basic job: they bypass the low-context resume filter and create a moment where a person with power inside a company stops and thinks, “I should at least look at this person seriously.”

### Warm Introductions

A warm introduction is when someone the company trusts says something like:

> “You should talk to this person. I’ve worked with them. They’re good.”

You already have more options for warm introductions than you might realize:

- You have completed at least one externship. That means you already have at least one founder or senior engineer who has seen you work. That person has friends, partners, and other founders who are looking for talent.
- You have your own existing network from previous jobs, school, and personal life. Many of those people either work in tech or know people who do.
- During the program, you met guest speakers, mentors, and other people in the Fractal network. Any of them can become a warm contact over time if you build real relationships.

From the hiring manager’s perspective:

- They might see thousands of resumes for a role.
- They might receive one or two warm introductions for that same role.

Your warm intro is not competing against thousands. It is competing against a handful. That is why it is so powerful.

### Networking Encounters

Sometimes the introduction happens live, at an event:

- You go to a meetup, hack night, or other tech event.
- You have an actual conversation with someone.
- They see how you think, how you communicate, and how you carry yourself.

In large cities like New York, there are more tech events than you could possibly attend. You can:

- Join meetups focused on the languages and domains you care about.
- Attend startup events, demo nights, and founder meetups.
- Talk to people, add them on LinkedIn, and follow up.

A single good conversation at the right event can give you:

- A new warm contact.
- A potential warm introduction later.
- A real person inside a company who will at least read your message carefully.

Humans overweight in-person impressions compared to documents. A five-minute conversation can outweigh a mediocre resume. If you tell them a good story about yourself, it will stand out in their mind. We have a whole guide on producing a good story [here](story.md).

### Spearfishing

The third type of introduction is the one almost no one uses, and it is where Fractal students have a huge edge:

> You pick a specific company, identify a real problem they have, build a targeted demo or tool that helps with that problem, and send it to them.

This technique is extremely effective at landing warm intros, which lead to interviews. We have a whole guide [here](./spearfishing.md).

## Turning Intros into Interviews

Warm introductions, networking, and spearfishing all do the same core job: they buy you a small burst of serious attention from a real human.

They do *not* guarantee a job. They do not even guarantee an interview.

What they really do is open a mental tab in someone’s head:

> “This person seems interesting. Should I invest more time in them?”

From that moment on, the question is: **Can you turn that initial curiosity into real belief that you would be a strong hire?**

This is where your [story](story.md), your portfolio, and your [resume](../resume/README.md) come in. They are not optional extras. They are the tools that convert a promising introduction into a concrete opportunity.

## Core Pieces of a Job Hunt

The Fractal strategy is simple:

- Use high-context introductions to get on someone’s radar.  
- Use a clear [story](story.md) and strong artifacts to make it easy for them to believe in you.  
- Then interviews become due diligence rather than a test or lottery.

Here is how the pieces fit together.

### Your Story

Once someone has a reason to pay attention to you, they immediately start trying to answer one question:

> “What kind of engineer is this, and can I imagine them on my team?”

If you do not supply a clear answer, their brain does nothing with the introduction. They forget you and move on.

Your story is the concise, specific answer to that question. It should make clear:

- What kinds of problems you like to work on.
- What kinds of tools, stacks, or domains you are strongest in.
- What you have actually built that is relevant.
- Why that combination is valuable to certain kinds of teams.

Vague stories are forgettable. Specific stories make you legible and memorable. You should follow the guide on crafting a good story [here](story.md).

A strong introduction plus a clear story is what allows someone inside a company to think, “I can see how this person would fit here.”

### Your Portfolio Projects

After hearing your [story](story.md), people look for evidence.

That evidence should be working software and concrete projects, not more adjectives.

Good portfolio projects:

- Are tightly aligned with your [story](story.md) and [lane](lane.md).
- Make sense to a bored hiring manager in under 15 seconds.
- Demonstrate real use cases, clear UX, or at least real taste and judgment.
- Are polished enough that someone could realistically imagine shipping them.

Think of your portfolio projects as the general version of [spearfishing](./spearfishing.md):

- Spearfishing shows what you can do for one company.
- Portfolio projects show what you can do in general, for any company that matches your [lane](lane.md).

If your story is “I build internal tools that automate annoying workflows,” your projects should make that feel obviously true without you saying another word.

### Your Portfolio Site

Most people will not dig through all your GitHub repos or read long READMEs. They will skim.

Your portfolio site exists to compress the signal:

- A clear, focused homepage that states who you are and what you do.
- One to three flagship projects, each with a short explanation and a visible demo or screenshots.
- Simple navigation that lets a busy person find what matters in seconds.

In 30 seconds, a busy person should understand your [lane](lane.md), see one or two concrete examples of your work, and feel that you care enough to polish your output.

This is not about fancy design for its own sake. It is about making it effortless for someone to understand why you are interesting.

### Your Resume

In the standard job hunt, the [resume](../resume/README.md) is the first and only thing anyone sees. That is why it ends up overloaded with fluff and buzzwords. It is trying to carry your entire story through a hostile, noisy filter.

In the Fractal strategy, the resume has a narrower, more realistic job. Your resume exists to back up a story people already want to believe about you, with concrete facts and numbers.

By the time someone opens your resume, ideally:

- They have already met you or received a strong introduction.
- They have heard your [story](story.md).
- They have seen at least one project that impressed them.

Now they are scanning for:

- Consistency with the story (“Does this timeline match what they told me?”).
- Evidence that you stick with things and deliver.
- Concrete signs of impact where possible (metrics, scope, responsibilities).

You should still apply [Fractal’s resume principles](../resume/README.md). Clarity, structure, and signal density matter. But you no longer pretend that a single page, dropped into a sea of thousands, is going to carry your entire job hunt.

### Interviews

If the earlier pieces are working, by the time you reach an interview, the situation should roughly be:

- Someone already believes you are promising.
- They have seen your work.
- They have some idea of how they might use you because you have a clear [lane](lane.md) and [story](story.md).

The interview is still challenging. You still need to prepare, to practice, and to perform under pressure. But the frame is different. You are not trying to convince a skeptical stranger that you are real. You are confirming that the positive impression they already have is accurate.

That is a much saner game than trying to cold-start that belief inside a timed online coding screen after being pulled randomly out of a pile.

## The Job Hunt Pipeline

One more framing that is important at Fractal: your job hunt is a pipeline, very similar to a sales funnel.

For any given period of time, you can think about your process in four stages:

1. **Prospecting:**  
   How many companies or teams have you identified as good targets for you? What is your [lane](lane.md)?

2. **Intro / Contact:**  
   How many of those targets have you reached in a high-context way?  
   (Warm introductions, real conversations, spearfishes, etc.)

3. **Serious Interest / Interview:**  
   How many of those contacts have turned into interviews or long, concrete conversations about working together? Did your [resume](../resume/README.md) and portfolio convince them to stay interested?

4. **Offers:**  
   How many of those interviews have turned into offers?

For most juniors, the pipeline is usually broken very early:

- They know very few target companies.
- They have almost no high-context introductions.
- They send hundreds of low-context applications instead.
- Nothing moves, and they conclude they are “bad at interviewing” even though they are not reaching interviews at all.

From a Fractal perspective:

- Early-stage problems (no prospects, no intros) are about your [**story**](story.md), [**lane**](lane.md), **networking**, and [**spearfishing**](./spearfishing.md).
- Mid-stage problems (people like you but are not moving to interviews) are often about **weak artifacts** (portfolio and resume not backing up the story).
- Late-stage problems (many interviews, no offers) are about **interview skills** and **anxiety management**, not about your story or value.

We are much happier when your problems are later in the pipeline! If you are getting consistent interviews, it means your story, portfolio, and introductions are working. Then we “only” need to train your interview skills and help you execute.

When you feel stuck, do not just say “the job market is bad.” Look at your pipeline:

- How many serious prospects do you have?
- How many high-context introductions have you created?
- How many interviews have you had in the last month?
- Where, exactly, is the drop-off?

That is where you should focus your effort, and that is what you should bring to instructors for help.

## 6. How to Use This Document

As you move through the job hunt, use this document as a map.

When things are not working, ask:

- Am I still secretly hoping that the resume blender will save me?
- Am I investing in warm intros and networking, or hiding behind job boards?
- Have I actually done serious spearfishing, or just sent slightly nicer cold emails?
- Is my story clear enough that someone could repeat it after one conversation?
- Do my portfolio projects and site make that story feel obviously true?
- Am I getting interviews and just struggling to convert them?

If the strategy feels “insanely good” but your results are not there yet, that is exactly the right conclusion: the model is sound, which means the work is to improve how you are running it.

You are not a victim of a mysterious, random market. You are running a pipeline. You have tools that are very powerful if executed well. Our job at Fractal is to help you execute them. Your job is to take this strategy seriously enough to stop relying on channels that were never built for you in the first place.
