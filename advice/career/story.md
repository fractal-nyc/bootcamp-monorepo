# Crafting Your Story

This document explains what a “story” is in the context of your job search, why it matters, and how to create one that feels personal and honest while still being clear and useful to employers. A strong story is not corporate copy. It is a short, true account of who you are, why you made the choices you made, and where you are trying to go.

The goal is to give people a way to relate to you and remember you, and to give yourself a narrative you actually believe.

## 1. The Problem We Are Solving

When someone meets you in a professional context—at a meetup, in a screening call, or during an interview—they are quietly trying to answer a few questions:

- Who is this person, really?  
- Why did they end up in software?  
- What kind of problems do they care about?  
- If I bring them onto my team, what future am I buying?

Your resume and portfolio answer “what you did.” They do not answer “why you did it” or “where this is going.” Without preparation, most people either:

- recite their resume chronologically,  
- give vague lines about “liking to solve problems,” or  
- apologize for their path (“I wasn’t sure what to do, so I tried coding”).

All of these land poorly. Interviewers know you had time to prepare. If your most rehearsed answer is fuzzy or weak, they will assume the rest of your thinking is fuzzy or weak.

A good story fixes this. It offers a short, emotionally grounded explanation of your past, your pivot, and your direction. It gives the listener a frame that makes the rest of your application make sense.

## 2. What a Story Is

A **story** is a short, coherent narrative that connects:

1. A few key threads from your past,  
2. Your decision to pivot into software and attend Fractal, and  
3. The direction you are now trying to move in (your lane).

It is personal. It can mention feelings, values, and small, vivid details. Those details are often what make you memorable. At the same time, a story is not a full autobiography. It is a distilled version of the truth that you can say out loud in 20–30 seconds without rushing.

A good story should feel like something you could tell a founder over coffee without cringing. It should also be something you can repeat often enough that it starts to “leak” into how you talk and write about yourself.

## 3. Why Your Story Matters

Your story does a few important jobs:

- It gives emotional scaffolding for your resume and projects.  
- It explains why your pivot into tech and into Fractal is deliberate, not accidental.  
- It signals your values and how you like to work.  
- It makes it easier for other people to remember you and talk about you to others.  
- It helps hiring managers predict your trajectory: *what happens if we bet on this person?*

You are not trying to impress everyone. You are trying to resonate strongly with a subset of people—especially founders and hiring managers who share some of your values and see themselves in your experiences.

## 4. The Required Components of a Strong Story

Every story will be different, but there are a few structural requirements. These are not optional; they keep the story grounded and useful.

### 4.1 A Coherent Thread From the Past

Choose one or two threads from your past that genuinely shaped how you think or work. Some ideas:

- an early experience with technology or building things,  
- repeated patterns in how you solve problems,  
- domain experience that changed the way you see the world, or  
- a personal frustration you kept running into and could not ignore.

This should be something you actually care about, not a line you think sounds good in a brochure.

You do **not** need to recite every job and every degree. You are showing the listener, “this is the kind of person I am and how I got that way.”

### 4.2 The Pivot, Framed as Agency

Every Fractal student must answer: *Why did you move into software, and why did you choose this program?*

You need to show that the pivot was an intentional move driven by your values, not something that “just happened to you.”

Weak versions sound like:
- “I wasn’t sure what to do, so I tried coding.”  
- “I couldn’t finish a degree, so I did a bootcamp instead.”  
- “Tech seemed like a good option, so I figured I’d give it a shot.”

Strong versions sound like:
- “I kept running into broken tools in my old field and realized I cared more about fixing the tools than tolerating them.”  
- “I wanted something intense and practical where I would be forced to build real systems every day, so I chose the hardest program I could find.”  
- “I wanted to put real skin in the game quickly instead of spending four years in a classroom.”

The point is: you **chose** this path. You are not drifting.

### 4.3 The Future Direction (Your Lane)

Your story should point toward a recognizable direction, even if it is not hyper-specific. This is where your [**lane**](lane.md) shows up.

You are answering: “Given who I am and what I’ve done, what kinds of problems and environments make sense for me next?”

Examples:
- “I’ve learned that I thrive in small, early-stage teams where I can own features end-to-end.”  
- “I’m strongest in backend-leaning work on systems where correctness actually matters.”  
- “I care a lot about the user experience side of tools, so I’m drawn to frontend-heavy work in products that ordinary people interact with every day.”

This does not lock in your whole future. It just tells the listener, “if you bet on me, here is the kind of engineer you are betting on.”

## 5. Personal, Not Corporate: What This Looks Like

To make this concrete, let’s look at how the **same person** can tell their story in shallow or deep ways.

### A Terrible, Unrehearsed Story

> I just graduated high school, I was thinking about college but didn't get into any of the ivies, and I've done some coding for video games, so I figured I should try to find a job in the tech industry if I can.

This implies aimlessness, failure, and a real lack of agency or control or direction. If I hire this person, I expect more of the same! They have no idea who they are or what they want!

### A Flat, Corporate Story

> “I’ve been programming since I was 12. I know a variety of languages including Java and assembly, and right now I’m focusing on early-stage startups where I can grow as a backend engineer.”

This is not terrible. It is intentional and not apologetic. But it is emotionally flat. It does not show much about values, curiosity, or what it feels like to be this person.

### 5.2 A Stronger, Personal Story

> “As a kid I got obsessed with game design. I wanted to make my own game for the Super Nintendo, and I didn’t know any better, so at 12 I learned assembly just to make that happen. That kicked off a very long love of programming for its own sake.  
>  
> I recently graduated valedictorian of my high school, and when I looked at the standard college path it didn’t make sense for me. I had already spent six years building things for fun. Instead I wanted to get real skin in the game as fast as possible, so I went straight into industry and then into a brutally intensive program where I ship real projects constantly. I basically eat, sleep, and breathe programming, and I’m especially excited about joining a small, scrappy team where I can work on almost anything as long as it’s a real problem in the world.”

Notice what changes:

- There are specific, vivid, supporting details (Nintendo, assembly at 12, valedictorian).  
- The pivot away from college is framed as an active choice, not a failure.  
- The values are obvious: hunger, intensity, love of hard problems.  
- The lane is implicit: small teams, early responsibility, real-world problems.

This is not “professional” in the corporate sense, but it is highly compelling for the right audience.

## 6. How to Generate Your Own Story

Use these steps as a guide, not as a rigid script.

1. **Collect your raw material.**  
   - Write down 3–5 experiences that actually mattered to you (they can be personal, work-related, or project-related).  
   - Circle the ones that feel most connected to who you are now.

2. **Find one or two threads from the past.**  
   - Ask: “What keeps showing up?” Curiosity? Care for users? Obsession with systems? Desire for autonomy?  
   - Choose one or two threads you are comfortable showing to strangers.

3. **Write your pivot as an active decision.**  
   - Why tech? Why now?  
   - Why this program, given all the other paths you could have taken?  
   - Make sure it sounds like a choice you made, not a fallback you accepted.

4. **Connect to your lane.**  
   - Given that past and that pivot, what kinds of work and environments make sense?  
   - Use the lane you already defined as a reference point.

5. **Draft a 3–5 sentence version.**  
   - Aim for something you can say in 20–30 seconds without speed-talking.  
   - Include at least one concrete detail that feels like *you*.

6. **Read it aloud.**  
   - If it sounds like corporate boilerplate, rewrite it until it feels like a real human talking.  
   - If it is rambling or defensive, tighten it.  
   - Remove anything you would not be willing to say to someone’s face.

7. **Check against evidence.**  
   - Make sure each claim is supported by your portfolio, your past work, or your actual behavior.  
   - If the story and the evidence do not match, adjust the story or (better) adjust your projects so they match.

## 7. Examples (Structure, Not Templates)

These are sketches to illustrate different shapes a story can take. Do not copy them. Use them to see how the pieces fit together.

**Design-Oriented Example:**  
“I’ve always had one foot in art and one foot in systems. For years I was the person friends asked to ‘make this thing make sense’—slides, posters, little websites—because I cared about how things looked and how people actually used them. Eventually I realized that what I enjoyed most was the design side of problem-solving: taking something confusing and turning it into something clear. I pivoted into software through an intensive program because I wanted to bring those design instincts into a field that often lacks them. I’m especially interested in frontend-heavy roles where getting the interface right genuinely matters for users like my parents or grandparents, who often struggle with bad software.”

**Domain-Pivot Example (Healthcare):**  
“I spent several years working in clinical environments, and over and over I watched good people get blocked by terrible tools. It bothered me enough that I started teaching myself to automate small pieces of my own work, and that was the first time software felt real to me. Eventually I decided I cared more about fixing those tools than just tolerating them, so I chose a program that would force me to build real things under pressure. Now I’m looking for small teams in health or adjacent areas where I can use that background to build systems that actually respect how people work.”

**Career-Changer Example:**  
“I used to run events and operations, which meant living in spreadsheets and constantly debugging messy systems made out of email, docs, and half-broken tools. Over time I noticed I was most alive when I was quietly rebuilding those systems to be less painful—for me and for everyone else. That realization pushed me toward software: I wanted more leverage and more control over the tools themselves. I chose a very demanding program instead of a slower path because I wanted to be immersed in building from day one. Going forward, I’m drawn to product-oriented engineering roles at small companies where I can be the person who notices where things are breaking and then actually fixes them in code.”

## 8. Your Next Step

Before the workshop, prepare:

- A written, 3–5 sentence version of your story that includes:  
  - one or two threads from your past,  
  - a clear, intentional pivot into software and Fractal, and  
  - a forward direction that matches your lane.  

- A spoken version you can deliver in 20–30 seconds without reading.

During the workshop, you will:

- Present your lane and your story to a small group,  
- Receive feedback on clarity, authenticity, and alignment, and  
- Revise your story until it feels both personal and usable in professional settings.

Your story should feel like the most honest, generous version of how you got here and where you are going—not a script written for a brochure. If you can achieve that, it will serve you across networking, interviews, and everything else that comes next.
