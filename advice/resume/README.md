# Resume Advice

This folder contains readings and a set of tools on how to create and evaluate a truly great resume.

## 1. What a resume is actually for

When someone is hiring, their scarcest resource is attention. They cannot interview everyone. They need a fast, low-effort way to decide who is worth an hour of conversation.

The resume is that filter.

A resume is a **one-page evidence sheet** that supports a specific professional story about you. It is not meant to fully represent you as a person. It is not meant to list everything you have done. It exists so that, in 15–30 seconds, a stranger can answer questions like:

- What kind of engineer is this person?  
- Are they plausibly able to do the work we need done?  
- Is there enough signal here to justify an interview?

In practice, the process often looks like this:

1. Someone hears about you: a warm intro, a cold email, a quick coffee, a referral. They get a **verbal story** about you: “full-stack engineer who just finished an intense program and shipped X and Y,” or “data-heavy background pivoting into applied AI.”

2. They then look at your resume to see if the **facts match the story**. They are looking for concrete evidence: roles, projects, impact, tools, scope.

3. If the resume and the story line up cleanly, you feel “real” to them. If the resume is confusing, overloaded, or tells a different story, they lose confidence and move on.

Resumes look objective because they are lists of facts: dates, titles, metrics, technologies. But the facts are selected, ordered, and framed. The narrative comes from:

- what you include or leave out;  
- what you choose to emphasize;  
- how you describe the consequences of your work.

Different selections of true facts can support very different narratives. Your job is to choose a narrative intentionally and then present only the facts that support it.

Two constraints fall directly out of this:

- The resume has to be **instantly legible**. If someone cannot understand you in 15–30 seconds, the document fails, no matter how impressive the content might be on a deep read.
- The resume has to be **narratively consistent** with whatever story you tell in email, in a call, or through a referrer. If those differ, people trust the paper more than the vibes, and the mismatch looks like either confusion or dishonesty.

The rest of this guide assumes this mental model: a resume is a short, high-signal artifact that makes a specific story about you feel believable.

Here are some great examples of Fractal Tech resumes:

## 2. Choose your target lane and story

Before you write anything, you need to decide what kind of engineer you are presenting yourself as. This is your **lane**.

Examples of lanes that make sense for most Fractal students:

- Full-stack web engineer (React/Next.js + Node + cloud)  
- Backend-leaning engineer with some distributed systems exposure  
- AI-native application engineer (product features built on top of LLMs and tooling)  
- Data-leaning engineer (pipelines + basic ML, not pure research)

Examples that are usually too vague or too grand given your evidence:

- “Software engineer, open to anything”  
- “Senior systems engineer” when you have zero production systems experience  
- “ML researcher” when you have only a couple of bootcamp projects

Picking a lane does not mean you are stuck in it for life. It means you are giving busy strangers a clear mental handle: “this is the type of work I should consider this person for.” If you refuse to choose, they will choose for you, and they will usually choose “no.”

### 2.1. Constraints specific to Fractal students

Most Fractal students are career pivoters or early-career engineers. That carries two realities you cannot hide:

- You do not have a decade of prior software experience.  
- You attended an intensive program (Fractal), which many people will mentally bucket with “bootcamps.”

Trying to dodge these facts never works. Reviewers will spot the gaps instantly. Instead, you need to **frame them on purpose**.

There are two questions sitting in the reviewer’s head as soon as they realize you are a pivot:

1. Why did this person switch into software now?  
2. Is this move a sign of high agency and focus, or is it a flail?

Your story should answer those questions in a way that is both honest and positive. For example:

- “I spent several years in healthcare, realized that I was mostly fighting broken tools, and decided to move into building them. I chose an intensive program where I could ship real projects quickly instead of another degree.”  
- “I did data science training, realized I liked building the systems and products around the models more than tuning the models themselves, and pivoted into full-stack work with heavy AI integration.”

Notice what these do:

- They acknowledge the prior career instead of pretending it did not exist.  
- They frame the pivot as a deliberate, high-agency choice rather than a failure.  
- They connect the old world to the new lane in a way that feels coherent.

This “why I’m here now” story mostly lives in how you talk about yourself and how you describe Fractal and your externships. The resume should support it by:

- showing real, shipped work in the new lane;  
- keeping the prior career visible but compressed;  
- emphasizing choices that look deliberate rather than random.

### 2.2. Making sure the story is actually supported by evidence

It is easy to pick a story that sounds good and then ignore the fact that your evidence does not support it. The guide needs to force you through the opposite process.

Once you’ve tentatively picked a lane, ask:

- Do I have work experience (including externships) that matches this lane?  
- Do I have 2–3 projects that clearly look like work in this lane?  
- Are there concrete impacts or results I can point to, or is everything coursework and toy demos?

If the answer is “not really,” you have two options:

- Adjust the lane to something your current evidence can support (for example, “full-stack engineer with strong data background” instead of “ML engineer”).  
- Or accept that you need to foreground different evidence (for example, a very strong externship) and narrow the story accordingly.

The key rule: **the story must obey the physics of your resume.** You cannot claim to be one kind of engineer and then fail to show any work that matches that claim. Reviewers will notice the gap immediately.

You will refine the story again after you inventory your evidence (next section) and see what you actually have. For now, the goal is to pick a lane that is:

- specific enough to be meaningful;  
- honest enough that you can back it up;  
- and aligned with the kinds of roles you actually want to pursue.

**Do not proceed past this step until you've written a story for yourself that feels true, exciting, and supportable my a resume. There is no way to judge a resume without knowing what story the resume is supposed to tell.**

## 3. Inventory your evidence

Before you start writing bullets or choosing section order, you need a clear view of what you have to work with. This step happens outside the resume: in a notebook, a doc, or whatever you like. The goal is to lay out all potential evidence, then decide later what makes the cut.

### 3.1. List all substantive work

Start with anything that looks like real work:

- Paid software roles (full-time, part-time, contract).
- Externships and internships from Fractal.
- Freelance or consulting work where someone outside Fractal depended on what you built.
- Open-source contributions that were reviewed and merged by maintainers.
- Prior non-tech roles that involved substantial technical or analytical work (if relevant).

For each item, capture:

- Organization or project name.  
- Your role or title.  
- Dates (rough is fine for now).  
- The problem being solved (for whom, and why it mattered).  
- What you actually built or did.  
- What changed because of it (metrics, user impact, reliability, speed, manual work saved, etc.).  
- The tech stack and any interesting constraints (scale, complexity, domain).

Do not filter yet. The point is to get the raw material out of your head and into a list.

### 3.2. Treat internships and externships as professional work

Many students undercut themselves by thinking, “this was just a bootcamp project” or “this was only an internship.” For our purposes, that distinction is mostly irrelevant.

If:

- the work solved a real problem for a real person or organization, and  
- the work would have been acceptable coming from a paid engineer at that company,

then it is professional-grade evidence.

Fractal is designed so that externships and serious capstones meet this bar. They exist to produce real artifacts and systems that someone actually uses or could use, not make-work exercises. If an external host merged your code, deployed your changes, or integrated your tool into their workflow, you should treat that as professional experience.

When you inventory your evidence:

- List externships right alongside jobs, not under “projects.”  
- Include the same kind of detail you would for a paid role: scope, ownership, impact, stack.  
- Assume that if the host trusted and kept your work, it is valid to present it as such.

We will later decide exactly how to label and position these, but in this phase they belong in the same pool as any other work that passed a real bar.

### 3.3. Capture projects, but focus on the serious ones

Next, list your projects:

- Fractal projects (personal and team-based).  
- Pre-Fractal projects, if they are relevant and non-trivial.  
- Open-source or personal tools with real users (even if the user is “me and three friends”).

For each, capture:

- One-line description of what it is and who it is for.  
- What you built (frontend, backend, infra, data, AI integration, etc.).  
- Any proof that it works in the real world: people using it, demoed to X, used in Y context, etc.  
- Any measurable outcomes (e.g., “used daily by the externship host’s team”).

Be honest about seriousness. A small toy app that barely works is not the same as a project that someone relied on during an externship. Both might appear later, but they are not equal evidence.

### 3.4. Include prior-career evidence selectively

If you are a career pivoter, list prior roles that might matter:

- Positions with clear leadership, ownership, or high-stakes responsibility.  
- Roles where you worked with data, systems, or tools in a way that obviously transfers.  
- Anything that directly supports the “why I pivoted” story you intend to tell.

Do not try to list your entire pre-tech resume. For now, just capture the few items that you might want as context or as a bridge.

### 3.5. Mark the strength of each piece of evidence

Once you have everything listed, go back and annotate each item with a quick strength label relative to your chosen lane:

- **Core** — strong, direct evidence for the lane (e.g., externship building an LLM-powered app if your lane is AI-native product engineer).  
- **Supporting** — useful context but not the main proof (e.g., data science apprenticeship that explains domain knowledge).  
- **Off-lane** — interesting but not strongly aligned (e.g., purely clinical rotations if you’re targeting backend engineer roles).

At this point you are not yet cutting anything. You are preparing for the next step, where you will reconcile what you want to be with what your history can actually substantiate.

## 4. Match and reconcile story and evidence

Now you have two things:

- A tentative lane and story from Section 2.  
- A labeled inventory of evidence from Section 3.

This section is about making those two line up. That means either tightening the story, choosing different evidence, or both.

### 4.1. Check how much “core” evidence you actually have

For the lane you picked, look only at the items you marked as **Core**.

Ask:

- Do I have at least one substantial piece of work experience (job, externship, serious freelance) that matches this lane?  
- Do I have at least 2–3 projects or work items that clearly show me doing this kind of work?  
- Can I identify a few concrete impacts that would sound credible to a hiring manager in this lane?

If the answer is “yes,” your story is probably viable.

If the answer is “barely” or “not really,” that is a sign:

- Either the lane is too ambitious for what you have today, or  
- You are overestimating weak evidence because it feels important to you personally.

The goal at this stage is not optimism. The goal is to align with how a skeptical reviewer will see your history on paper.

### 4.2. Adjust the story or adjust what you include

There are only a few legitimate moves here:

1. **Narrow or shift the lane slightly.**  
   Example: change from “ML engineer” to “full-stack engineer with strong data/ML background,” if most of your evidence is web apps plus some models.

2. **Re-center on the strongest work you actually have.**  
   Example: if your best work is an externship building an AI feature for a small company, that becomes the anchor, and the rest of the resume is arranged to support that story.

3. **Drop or compress items that fight the story.**  
   Example: a long section on an unrelated prior career might need to be reduced to a single line, or removed entirely.

You do not get to:

- Keep a grand story that your evidence cannot support; or  
- Keep every experience and expect the narrative to sort itself out.

This is the point where you decide which parts of your past will be visible and which will effectively not exist for a busy reader.

### 4.3. Decide what role pre-tech experience plays in the story

Look at the prior-career items you listed:

- If an item directly strengthens your narrative (e.g., clinical background for a healthcare-tools engineer), it can appear in Education or Work with one or two sharp bullets.  
- If an item is prestigious but not directly relevant, it might be worth a single line to signal competence and discipline.  
- If an item is neither relevant nor particularly strong, it probably should not appear at all.

The key is to avoid letting pre-tech experience dominate the page. The resume needs to make it obvious that you are now an engineer, not a former X who happens to be dabbling in code.

### 4.4. Identify your backbone experiences

By the end of this step, you should be able to underline:

- 1–3 work experiences (including externships) that will form the backbone of your Work Experience section.  
- 2–3 projects that clearly support your lane and demonstrate additional skills or ownership.  
- A minimal set of education and prior-career details that provide context without hijacking the story.

Everything else is either supporting detail that will be compressed, or noise that will be removed.

Once you have this backbone, you are ready to decide the exact structure and ordering of sections (Section 5) and then start drafting bullets that express impact clearly (Section 7).

## 5. Decide structure and ordering

At this point you have:

- A chosen lane and story.  
- A set of backbone experiences and projects.

Now you need to decide how to lay these out on the page so the story is obvious on a fast scan.

### 5.1. Recommended section order for Fractal students

A reasonable default order is:

1. Contact information  
2. (Optional) one-line professional summary  
3. Work Experience (including externships)  
4. Projects  
5. Education  
6. Skills

This order prioritizes what matters most to a hiring manager: what work you have done that resembles work they would ask you to do.

### 5.2. Work Experience section

This is the main section of your resume. Design it around your backbone experiences.

- List each role with:
  - Company or organization name  
  - Your title  
  - Location (optional)  
  - Dates  
- Under each role, include 2–5 bullets focused on impact and responsibilities relevant to your lane.

Externships and serious consulting engagements should appear here, not under Projects. They are work.

You may choose to order roles slightly by relevance rather than strictly by time, as long as the timeline is still clear and not misleading. For example, a very strong recent externship aligned with your lane might appear above a less relevant older job, even if the dates overlap or are close together.

### 5.3. Projects section

Projects exist to:

- Show evidence for skills not visible in Work Experience.  
- Demonstrate initiative, ownership, and the ability to ship.  
- Reinforce the lane you have chosen.

Keep this section focused:

- 2–3 substantive projects is usually enough.  
- Each project should have:
  - A name and one-line description of what it is and who it is for.  
  - 1–3 bullets explaining what you built and what impact it had.  
- If a project is essentially the same as something already described in Work Experience (for example, a tool you built during an externship), do not duplicate it at full length. Either keep it under Work Experience or give it a single, concise reference in Projects.

### 5.4. Education section

Education should provide context, not dominate the page.

- List degrees and major programs with:
  - Institution  
  - Degree / program name  
  - Graduation date or expected date  
- For most Fractal students, detailed curriculum bullets are not necessary. If you include any, keep them to 1–2 concise lines per major program and focus on what is most relevant to your lane.

Fractal will be treated specially in the next section.

### 5.5. Skills section

The Skills section should confirm and summarize what the rest of the resume already implies.

- Group skills into a small number of categories (for example: Languages, Frameworks, Tools / Platforms).  
- Include only technologies and tools that:
  - You have used in meaningful work or serious projects.  
  - Directly support the lane you are presenting.

If something does not appear anywhere else on the resume, think carefully before listing it here. A skill that is not backed by any evidence tends to look weak.

## 6. Handle special cases: Fractal, externships, pre-tech career

Certain recurring elements require consistent handling so that they strengthen the story instead of confusing it.

### 6.1. Fractal Tech

Fractal should be presented as an intensive, applied engineering program, not as generic coursework.

**Title guidance:**

In the Education section, a good default is:

- `Fractal Tech — Software Engineering Fellowship (full-time, ~700+ hours; six-day weeks)`

This communicates intensity and seriousness without using the word “bootcamp.”

**Description guidance:**

Keep the description short (2–4 bullets). Emphasize:

- Building and shipping full-stack applications (briefly mention core technologies).  
- Heavy use of AI-native development practices (integrating LLMs, working with APIs and tooling).  
- The presence of real externships / client work as part of the program.  
- High-volume, team-based engineering practices (code review, pair programming, demos).

Avoid long topic lists (“learned X, Y, Z”) and marketing phrases. The goal is to show that you operated in a demanding environment that resembles an engineering team.

### 6.2. Externships

Externships should be in the Work Experience section and should read like real roles.

For each externship:

- Use a title that matches what you were doing:
  - “Externship Engineer”  
  - “Software Engineering Extern”  
  - “AI Application Engineer (Externship)”  
- List the host organization and dates.  
- Write bullets that look exactly like job bullets:
  - What problem you were solving.  
  - What you built.  
  - Who used it.  
  - What changed as a result (time saved, workflow improved, manual work reduced, etc.).

You do not need to apologize for externships being short or unpaid. Their value on the resume comes from the reality of the work, not the compensation model.

### 6.3. Pre-tech career

Pre-tech experience can help or hurt depending on how it is handled.

Include pre-tech roles when:

- They are clearly relevant to your lane (for example, clinical background for healthcare-tools engineering).  
- They are prestigious or high-responsibility roles that signal competence and reliability.  
- They help explain your pivot in a way that is consistent with the story you are telling.

When you include them:

- Compress them. Typically 1–2 bullets is enough.  
- Emphasize responsibilities, systems, or outcomes that connect to your current lane (data handling, process improvement, high-stakes decision-making).

Exclude or minimize pre-tech roles when:

- They do not add anything to the story you are telling.  
- They take up space that would be better used by engineering work and projects.

The overall effect should be that the reader understands where you came from, but sees you clearly as an engineer now.

---

## 7. Draft the content: bullets, projects, skills

With structure and special cases settled, you can start drafting the actual text that will appear on the resume. Feel free to use an LLM as part of the process, but remember: it doesn't know the story of your life or your own personal taste as well as you do.

### 7.1. Writing effective bullets

Each bullet should do two things:

1. State a concrete impact or outcome.  
2. Provide just enough technical or process detail to make that impact credible.

A simple pattern that works well:

- Start with a verb plus impact: “Reduced X by Y,” “Shipped Z used by N users,” “Implemented A to enable B.”  
- Follow with specifics: what system, what scale, what tools.

Examples (abstracted):

- “Built and deployed an internal tool that automated data validation for hospital finance submissions, reducing manual review time by ~40%.”  
- “Implemented LLM-driven report generation for clinicians, integrating with existing documentation workflows and cutting average drafting time from hours to minutes.”

Guidelines:

- Keep bullets to 1–2 lines.  
- Avoid vague verbs like “helped,” “participated,” “worked on.” Use stronger, clearer language: “implemented,” “designed,” “owned,” “led,” “deployed.”  
- Avoid long narrative or storytelling. The resume is not where you explain every detail; it is where you highlight the most important ones.

### 7.2. Writing project entries

For each project you decide to include:

- Name the project.  
- In one short line, describe what it is and who it is for.  
- Add 1–3 bullets focusing on:
  - What you built (especially what you personally owned).  
  - Any usage or adoption.  
  - Any measurable results or constraints that made it interesting.

Try to make projects read like scaled-down versions of work experience. The main difference is that projects may have fewer users and shorter timelines, not that they are structured completely differently.

If a project has no users and no impact beyond “I built this to learn X,” be honest about that in how much space you give it. It might still be useful if it rounds out your stack, but it should not compete with externships or more serious work.

### 7.3. Finalizing the skills section

Use the inventory and lane you chose to decide what goes into Skills.

- Group skills in a small number of categories (for example: Languages, Frameworks, Tools / Platforms, Data / ML).  
- Include only technologies that:
  - Appear elsewhere in your resume in work or projects; or  
  - You are confident you could discuss or use under interview conditions.

Avoid:

- Very long lists.  
- Obscure tools that are not central to your story.  
- Listing the same thing in multiple ways (for example, both “JavaScript” and “ES6” if that does not add new information).

The Skills section should confirm the reader’s impression from Work and Projects, not introduce a new, unrelated dimension.

---

## 8. Compress and cut down to one page

Once you have a complete draft, you will almost certainly be over one page. This is expected. The next step is to compress.

### 8.1. Merge and trim bullets

Look for bullets that:

- Repeat roughly the same idea.  
- Describe low-level implementation details that do not change the reader’s overall understanding.  
- Contain extra phrases that can be removed without losing meaning.

Combine or shorten them. Prioritize keeping:

- The clearest descriptions of impact.  
- The most technically or contextually interesting details.  
- The bullets that best support your lane.

### 8.2. Remove weaker projects

If you still need to save space:

- Drop projects that are:
  - Least aligned with your lane.  
  - Least serious in terms of usage or impact.  
  - Redundant with stronger work you already describe elsewhere.

Two strong projects are better than five that are mediocre or overlapping.

### 8.3. Simplify education and pre-tech sections

Reduce long education descriptions to:

- Degree / program  
- Institution  
- One concise line of context if needed

Compress pre-tech roles into single lines or very short entries, unless they are central to your story. The goal is to keep the focus on your current engineering identity.

### 8.4. Remove references and other low-value sections

Do not include:

- A full References section with names and contact information.  
- “References available upon request” lines.  
- Hobbies sections, unless they directly support your story in a meaningful way.

These consume space without helping a reviewer decide whether to interview you.

### 8.5. Check the result visually

When you believe you are at one page:

- Print to PDF or actually print on paper.  
- Look at it as a reader would: from a bit of distance, in a few seconds.

You should be able to see:

- Clear section separation.  
- A small number of roles and projects that catch the eye.  
- No obviously dense blocks of text that feel overwhelming.

If anything looks crowded or unreadable, adjust spacing and trim text until the page feels stable and easy to scan.

## 9. Self-review against the principles

Before you involve an LLM or another person, you should sanity-check your own resume against the principles.

### 9.1. The 10-second test

Look at the resume as if you were a skeptical hiring manager with very little time.

In 10 seconds, you should be able to answer:

- What lane is this person in?  
- What is the strongest piece of evidence that they can do that kind of work?

If you cannot answer both, the resume is not clear enough yet. That usually means:

- The Work Experience section is too weak, too short, or too vague.  
- The Projects section is too long or unfocused.  
- The summary (if present) is generic and not anchored in concrete evidence.

### 9.2. The 30-second test

Give yourself 30 seconds and read slightly more deeply.

Ask:

- What 2–3 concrete things would I remember about this person if I closed the document now?  
- Do those things match the lane I chose?  
- Are there any sections that feel like they belong to a different story (for example, long pre-tech descriptions, unrelated skills, or side projects that do not connect)?

If the main takeaways are not aligned with your intended story, you need to cut or compress the parts that are interfering.

### 9.3. Red flag checklist

Scan for these common issues:

- More than one page.  
- More than 3 projects with substantial space each.  
- A long education section that lists topics and tools instead of outcomes.  
- A references section with names and contact information.  
- Skills section that is noticeably longer than Work + Projects.  
- Bullets that mostly describe tasks and technologies, with no clear impact.  
- Visible duplication (the same project or tool described at length in multiple places).

If any of these are present, fix them before moving on. The goal is to resolve the obvious problems so that external reviewers can focus on higher-level issues.


## 10. LLM teardown and iteration

Once you have a one-page resume that passes your own checks, you can use an LLM to perform a structured review. The goal is to get targeted, high-quality criticism and concrete suggestions, not generic encouragement.

### 10.1. What to provide to the LLM

Use [this template, prompt.md](prompt.md).

When you ask an LLM for feedback, you should always provide three things:

1. **Your lane and story (in your own words)**  
   - 2-5 sentences on your "professional story" from Section 2: who are you, why are you an engineer, what do you want?
   - One sentence on the lane you are targeting (e.g., “full-stack engineer with AI feature experience”). 

2. **The principles**  
   - Paste the [Fractal Resume Principles in principles.md](./principles.md)
   - Make it clear that the model should use these as a strict standard.

3. **Your resume**
    - Attach a PDF so formatting is preserved.

Without all three, the model is more likely to drift into generic advice. You are not asking the LLM to “make the resume better” in a vague way. You are asking it to run specific checks and propose specific edits, constrained by the principles and by the facts you have provided.

### 10.3. How to interpret and apply the feedback

When you get the LLM’s response:

- First, check whether its inferred story (step 1) matches the lane you chose. If it does not, that is a sign that your resume is not communicating clearly.  
- Look at the list of violations (step 2) and proposed cuts (step 3). Treat these as suggestions, not commands, but assume they are directionally useful unless they obviously misunderstand your work.  
- For the rewritten bullets (step 4), check that:
  - They are faithful to what you actually did.  
  - They do not add invented numbers, responsibilities, or tools you did not use.  
  - They are clearer and more impact-focused than your originals.

If you see hallucinated content (for example, the model adding metrics that you never mentioned), do not accept it. Either correct the bullet yourself using the improved structure, or discard that suggestion.

Finally, apply the changes you agree with and re-run a quick version of:

- The 10-second and 30-second tests from Section 9.  
- A shorter LLM review, if needed, focusing only on the parts you changed.

Stop iterating once:

- The lane and story are obvious to a fresh reader.  
- The resume fits on one page without feeling cramped.  
- Every major section has a clear role in supporting your identity as an engineer.

Then chat with an instructor and get their feedback!
