# Fractal Resume Principles

This document defines the standards Fractal uses to evaluate resumes. It describes how to present a clear professional identity, how to select and structure content, and how to communicate evidence in a concise, readable format. The aim is a resume that can be understood in 15–30 seconds and leaves a coherent impression of what the candidate is capable of.

---

## 1. Establish a single professional narrative

A resume should communicate one clear professional identity. The reader should be able to answer “what kind of engineer is this person?” almost immediately. This identity should be supported by the work you choose to highlight, the ordering of sections, and the language used to describe your contributions. Anything that doesn’t reinforce this narrative introduces noise.

---

## 2. Limit the resume to one page

One page forces prioritization and clarity. If the resume requires more than one page, the underlying issue is almost always a lack of selectivity rather than a lack of space.

---

## 3. Lead with impact

Each bullet should express the impact of the work before describing the process. Focus on measurable or observable outcomes: performance improvements, reliability gains, feature adoption, user metrics, throughput changes, reduction in manual effort, or similar. Process details or tool references should be included only when they directly clarify how you achieved the result.

---

## 4. Avoid descriptive or promotional language

Resumes should avoid adjectives that try to create an impression without supplying evidence (e.g., “high-impact,” “mission-critical,” “robust”). The goal is to let the results speak for themselves through clear, concrete statements.

---

## 5. Prioritize real-world experience over projects

Paid work, externships, and internships generally communicate more signal than personal projects. These should appear first and should receive the majority of the space. Projects matter when they demonstrate skills not visible in prior roles or when they reinforce the core identity, but they should not overwhelm the resume.

---

## 6. Exercise strict selectivity

Every line on the page should either advance the narrative or supply direct evidence for it. Remove content that adds detail without adding clarity. Remove content that repeats the same idea. Remove content that contradicts or distracts from the professional identity you are presenting.

---

## 7. Keep the skills section aligned with the narrative

Skills sections should be short and intentional. List the tools, languages, or systems that directly support the story you are telling. Avoid long laundry lists or anything that implies superficial familiarity across too many domains.

---

## 8. Describe Fractal Tech clearly and consistently

Fractal should not be framed as coursework. Instead, describe it as a demanding, applied engineering environment.

Recommended rough phrasing:
**Fractal Tech — Software Engineering Fellowship (full-time, 700+ hours; six-day weeks)**

Recommended rough description elements:
- Intensive applied engineering curriculum with a focus on building and shipping full-stack applications.
- Heavy use of AI-native development practices and modern tooling.
- Multiple shipped projects executed individually and in small teams.
- Externship placements delivering real value to external clients.

Keep this section concise and focused on tangible output rather than topics learned.

---

## 9. Treat externships as professional experience

Externships should appear in the Work Experience section. Their descriptions should follow the same pattern as job experience: what you built, who used it, what changed because of it, and any measurable results. Avoid describing externships as “projects.”

---

## 10. Keep summaries minimal

If you use a short professional summary, limit it to one sentence that clearly states the professional identity you want the reader to anchor on. Avoid multi-line summaries, objectives, or personal statements.

---

## 11. Present information in an order that reinforces the story

Put the most relevant and highest-signal material first. Order sections so that the reader encounters your strongest evidence early. The overall structure should feel intentional rather than chronological for its own sake.

---

## 12. Maintain clean and readable formatting

Use consistent spacing, clear section headers, and a readable font. Aesthetic polish is valuable, but it should never obscure the content or compensate for weak material.

---

## Summary

A strong resume is a concise representation of a single professional narrative, supported by concrete evidence. It communicates impact clearly, avoids unnecessary detail, and presents the candidate’s work in a coherent and accessible structure. These principles exist to enforce clarity, focus, and relevance.
