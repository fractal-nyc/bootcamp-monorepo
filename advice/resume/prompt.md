I am a career-pivoting engineer applying for roles as a **[your lane here]**. My story is **[story here]**, which people may have heard in some form before seeing my resume.
  
Here are the principles my resume should follow:  
**[paste the Fractal Resume Principles]** 

My resume is attached in a PDF.
  
Please do the following:  
  1. State in 1–2 sentences what story you think my resume is telling right now.  
  2. Compare my resume against the principles above. List the specific ways it **violates or weakly satisfies** those principles. Be concrete: point to specific sections, bullets, or phrases.  
  3. Identify any sections, bullets, or projects that you think should be removed or significantly shortened to better support my lane. Explain why.  
  4. Identify 3–5 of my weakest bullets and rewrite them to be clearer and more impact-focused, **using only the facts I have provided**. Do not invent metrics, titles, or responsibilities I did not mention.  
  5. Suggest an improved ordering of sections and entries, if the current ordering does not make my lane obvious in 10–30 seconds.  
  
Be direct and critical. Focus on alignment with the principles and clarity of the story, not on being encouraging.
