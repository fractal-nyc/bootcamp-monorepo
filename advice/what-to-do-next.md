# Choosing Your Next Project

When you finish a project or internship, you’ll often hit the same question: **what should I work on next?**  
This document exists so you can answer that for yourself before coming to an instructor. Read it, think it through, and bring two or three concrete options you’re considering. We’ll help you choose, but the goal is for you to do the thinking first.

## How to Think About “What’s Next”

By the end of the program, you should be strong across four dimensions:

| Axis | What “Full” Looks Like |
|------|------------------------|
| **Portfolio** | A polished site with a few standout projects that demonstrate skill, taste, and technical depth. |
| **Fundamentals** | A solid grasp of computer science and general engineering principles—you can orient quickly in any unfamiliar codebase. |
| **Real-World Experience** | At least one internship where you built for real users under production constraints. |
| **Spearfishing / Network** | You know how to reach out cold, build compelling demos, and create your own opportunities. |

There’s no strict order. You’ll move between these based on what’s currently weakest or most relevant. Some areas depend on others—e.g. it’s better to polish your portfolio before spearfishing, and better to have at least one internship before chasing a conversion.

When you’re unsure, default to **what seems genuinely fun or interesting**. People who follow intrinsic motivation make faster progress. Sustained curiosity beats forced discipline.

Finally, remember: these are guidelines, not hard rules. If you’ve got a project idea that doesn’t fit neatly into any category but seems exciting and valuable, **pitch it anyway**. We’ll help you decide whether to pursue it.

## Option 1: Portfolio Project

**Purpose**  
Build something ambitious and appealing that strengthens your public footprint. Portfolio projects signal quality and taste. They live on your site, your GitHub, and in your demos.

**When It’s the Right Choice**  
- Your portfolio site is thin or dated.  
- You’ve just finished an internship and want to work on your own idea.  
- You have an exciting concept that feels achievable in one to two weeks.

**What You Produce**  
A complete, deployed project with a clean repo and short write-up—something you’d proudly feature on your website.

**Pitfalls**  
- Choosing something too small or unscoped.  
- Stopping once “it works” instead of finishing the UX and polish.  
- Neglecting the write-up or documentation.

## Option 2: Internship

**Purpose**  
Internships are how you gain real-world experience, learn production practices, and earn references that matter. They come in two broad types:

1. **Learning-Focused Internships**  
   - Goal: Exposure, practice, and credible experience for your resume.  
   - Outcome: You gain context for how real teams work and ship, plus a warm reference for later.

2. **Conversion-Oriented Internships**  
   - Goal: A potential path to full-time employment.  
   - Outcome: A live audition—these are effectively “tryouts” for the industry.  
   - Expectation: You should feel strong across all axes (portfolio, fundamentals, prior experience) and ready to execute at a professional level. These usually make sense later in the program.

**When It’s the Right Choice**  
- You haven’t had real-world experience yet.  
- You want feedback from external engineers.  
- You’re ready for a potential conversion opportunity.

**What You Produce**  
Shipped features, merged PRs, or public demos that demonstrate impact. The best internships also yield strong references.

**Pitfalls**  
- Accepting a scope so vague that you can’t measure success.  
- Treating it as “task completion” instead of an opportunity to learn how production systems actually work.  
- Jumping into a conversion-oriented internship before you’re technically and emotionally ready.

## Option 3: Research or Deep Technical Project

**Purpose**  
Strengthen your core understanding of how systems work. If you’ve been living mostly at the framework or app level, this is a chance to build low-level intuition and range.

**When It’s the Right Choice**  
- You feel gaps in your understanding of systems or theory.  
- You’re drawn to more technical or conceptual topics (AI, compilers, cryptography, etc.).  
- You want to slow down, think deeply, and still build things.

**Examples**  
- Andrej Karpathy’s *Zero to Hero* series  
- *Nand2Tetris*  
- Harvard’s *CS50*  
- A self-directed dive into “how X works” (e.g., how blockchains or recommendation systems function)

**What You Produce**  
Working artifacts: prototypes, tools, or demos that embody what you learned. Every cycle of study should produce code.

**Pitfalls**  
- Reading endlessly without building.  
- Staying abstract instead of proving understanding through working examples.

## Option 4: Spearfishing

**Purpose**  
Proactively create opportunities by targeting companies you admire and pitching through code. You build a small demo that relates to their product and send it directly to someone there.

**When It’s the Right Choice**  
- Your portfolio is strong.  
- You’ve already completed at least one internship.  
- You want to open doors or convert into a full-time role.

**What It Looks Like**  
You build something small but thoughtful—maybe a feature idea or integration—and send a short message like:  
> “I love what you’re doing at X. Here’s a one-day demo I built inspired by your product. Want to see day two?”

This approach works surprisingly well when the demo is scoped tightly and well-executed.

**Pitfalls**  
- Over-scoping or over-engineering.  
- Sending outreach without a strong artifact.

## Choosing Among Them

Think of your progress as balancing meters:

| If you... | Then Consider... |
|------------|------------------|
| Haven’t done an internship | **Internship (learning-focused)** |
| Have no polished portfolio | **Portfolio Project** |
| Feel shaky on fundamentals | **Research / Deep Technical Project** |
| Have a strong portfolio and prior experience | **Spearfishing** or a **Conversion-Oriented Internship** |

If multiple apply, pick the one that seems most fun or energizing. Intrinsic motivation is an extremely powerful tool that will allow you to move towards your goals faster than anything else.

## Before You Talk to an Instructor

Come prepared with:  
- 2–3 project directions or internship paths you’re considering.  
- Reasoning on why each appeals to you and what you’d build or learn.  
- Any blockers or questions you want to discuss.

These conversations work best when you’ve already thought through your priorities. Our job is to help you refine direction, not assign one.
