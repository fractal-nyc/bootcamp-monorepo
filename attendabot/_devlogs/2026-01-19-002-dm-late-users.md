# 2026-01-19-002: DM Late Users Instead of Channel Message

## Summary

Changed attendance/EOD verification to send private DMs to users who haven't posted instead of publicly calling them out in the channel. Also limited PR leaderboard to top 3 places (with ties).

## What We Did

### 1. Backend: Direct Message Helper

- Added `sendDirectMessage()` function to discord service for sending DMs to users
- Returns boolean indicating success/failure for tracking

### 2. Backend: Private Reminders via DM

- Updated `verifyPosts()` to DM each late user individually instead of posting a public mention list
- Each user receives: "Reminder: You still need to post your {label} update for {date} in #{channel}."
- Tracks how many DMs were successfully sent

### 3. Backend: Top 3 PR Leaderboard

- Limited PR leaderboard to show only top 3 places
- Includes ties (e.g., if 2 people tie for 2nd, both shown)
- Cleaner output with "(Top 3)" label

## Files Modified

- `backend/src/services/discord.ts` - Added sendDirectMessage() function
- `backend/src/bot/index.ts` - Updated verifyPosts() for DMs, limited leaderboard to top 3

## Results

- Late users receive private reminders instead of public call-outs
- Less noisy channel messages
- PR leaderboard focused on top performers only
