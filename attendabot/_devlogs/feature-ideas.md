# Random thoughts

- Probably don't want to do LLM analysis on every single message that someone sends. Also probably don't want to store each individual message that a user sends, especially if it's decontextualized. What's the most useful thing? If we DO want to respond proactively to high-priority messages though, we could look for keywords. Probably most useful would be to synthesize their Discord and Github output, plus any blog posts they've written or tweets they've sent.
