# 2026-01-13-001: Startup DM and Deployment Improvements

## Summary

Added DirectMessages intent and startup DM notification, plus improved deployment script to sync .env file.

## What We Did

### 1. Discord Direct Messages

- Added `DirectMessages` gateway intent to allow the bot to send DMs
- Bot now sends a DM to a configured user (via `DAVID_USER_ID` env var) when it starts up
- Confirms the bot is online and DM functionality is working

### 2. Deployment Script

- Added `scp` command to `update-bot.sh` to upload the local `.env` file to EC2
- Ensures environment variables stay in sync between local and production

## Files Modified

- `backend/src/services/discord.ts` - Added DirectMessages intent and startup DM
- `update-bot.sh` - Added scp command for .env upload

## Environment Variables

New variable required:
- `DAVID_USER_ID` - Discord user ID to receive startup notification DM
