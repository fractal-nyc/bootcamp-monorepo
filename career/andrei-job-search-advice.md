3. **Turn on LinkedIn Jobs emails.** Once you start using LinkedIn regularly, it is good at sourcing jobs for you.

4. **Always apply via the company website's Careers page.** Much higher response rate than LinkedIn.

5. **Apply to 10-15 jobs per week.**

6. **Make a ChatGPT 'project' or folder for your job search to make writing applications easy.**

I paste in the job description and tell it to answer mandatory questions on the app (e.g. your biggest career achievement) and tell it to talk about a specific project i think relates the most. i usually edit the starting point chatgpt gives me a lot and paste it back in so it knows for next time - about a month of this has made the editing much more minimal. also uploaded my resume/linkedin text previously and it has a memory of that somewhere
