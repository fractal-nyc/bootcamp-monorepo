### Career Trajectory Club

Once the cohort ends, job-seeking alumni meet once a week at the career trajectory club. 1-2 instructors also attend.

**Goal:** Every person is unblocked, gets the resources and help they need, and is set up for an efficient and productive week. 

**Meeting Structure:** We spend 8-10 minutes simultaneously answering questions in a Google doc about our goals next week, how our previous week’s goals went, and a quick reflection on our high level 1-3 year career goals. We then spend 10 minutes reading through everyone else’s answers and commenting. And then each person gets up to 2 minutes each to talk about anything they’re blocked on and ask for help.

**IRL & Zoom:**
For New Yorkers, the meeting takes place at Fractal Tech in the lounge. For people who are remote, there is a zoom link. Everyone works from the same doc, but the unblocking conversations are held separately (the remote people meet together and the IRL people meet together).
