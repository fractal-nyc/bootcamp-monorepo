## Demo Video
- Make a demo video of your project.
- If it was a group project, each person should make their own demo video, rather than one group video.
- I recommend recording a screenshare video using [loom](https://www.loom.com/). 
- The script/narrative arc of your video should go something like this: <em>“I worked on a small team to build [description of your app]. Our goal was [description of your goal]. Here’s how it works: [walk the viewer through your app]. We built this using [tech stack]”</em>
- On LinkedIn there is a “featured” section. Add your video to that section.
- A link to the video posted on LinkedIn counts as 1 PR.
