## The Job Search Algorithm 

### A. Optimize Online Presence  
1. Make sure you've updated your LinkedIn, website, Twitter etc. You may want to reference and complete the [Career Speedrun Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B9odhPK6rniV_xye7eWdwwr1yLHyGUnzVVNJDnQivkk/edit?usp=sharing).  
2. Have 3 professionals review your LinkedIn, website, resume, and email copy.  

### B. Tap Your Network  
- Make a big list of people who could help you and then message them. We recommend following [Alterman's All-American Outreach Workbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gif1am4T0CRESkXKiK6RjaciRciwTfjRoM-7ctnp34A/edit?usp=sharing).
  - And especially: who are the superconnectors in your network?
- Message or email us too! We are part of your network, and the right message is easy for us to forward to people who can potentially help you. We are name@fractalbootcamp.com [Andrew, Paris, Jake, Andy, Priya, Shanthi, David, Regan] 

### C. Spearfishing for Jobs  
1. Identify target company & role.  
2. Follow the [value worksheet](https://github.com/fractal-bootcamp/bootcamp-monorepo/blob/main/career/value_worksheet.md).   
3. Look for intros via LinkedIn/Twitter.  
4. Send targeted outreach directly. 

[to do: Andrew wants to create a value worksheet for step 2 that students can follow to help think through how to provide the most value to target company]
