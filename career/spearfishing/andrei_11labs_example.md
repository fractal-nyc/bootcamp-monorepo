The email below resulted in Andrei (a student in Su2025) getting an interview with ElevenLabs, and eventually getting to the final interview. Unfortunately at that point they told him that their head count had changed and all hiring was paused, but this strategy essentially worked.

Hi Tanner, 

Thanks again for hosting the FDE event last Tuesday! After speaking with the team, I was really drawn to the culture at ElevenLabs and feel my previous experience aligns closely with what you’re looking for. 

I have a background in VC and PM, most recently at Warner Bros. Discovery and NBCUniversal. I helped start WBD’s APM program and implemented custom AI products at NBCU News Group. Having often been on the receiving end of FDEs and Solutions Engineers, I grew frustrated with slow processes and the lack of learning. I left in May to get closer to building again and am now wrapping up Fractal’s six days a week engineering finishing school. I have experience running FDE-style projects and technical skills. 

As an example, I was interested in your APIs after the event but noticed that text to speech, when sped up, could sound better. I built this little demo (using the v2 model, but v3 seems even cooler) to help me listen to written articles faster: https://smart-speed.vercel.app/ 

You can learn more about my recent projects on my site or LinkedIn. 

I just submitted the interest form and am excited to learn more about the role! 

Best, 
Andrei
