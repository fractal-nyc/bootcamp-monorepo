# Spearfishing:

[Inspired by Patio11](https://x.com/patio11/status/1344313750334046210)

## The Process
1. Choose one company where you would learn from an internship.

If you’re not sure which company to spearfish, here are some questions to ask yourself:
- Are there any products or businesses you really love?
- Do you have any friends who work at interesting companies and might be able to forward an introduction? 
- Do any of the companies mentioned in the What To Do After Bootcamp resources interest you?
- Are there any companies in NYC that are hiring?
In general, we recommend spearfishing companies that are actively hiring, so that your internship has the potential to become a job offer. That said, at this early in the bootcamp, working at a company that excites you will be worth your time, whether they’re hiring or not.


2. Identify the individual decision-maker (ideally the founder, possibly other people strongly publicly identified with the company) that you can reach out to. Bonus if they are on Twitter since Twitter DMs will convert more than LinkedIn or email.


3. Use their product and identify 3 possible improvements or additions to their product. A lot of companies are behind the curve on AI. Imagine if there are ways that AI could improve their product or solve one of their problems.


4. What is one improvement that you could build a demo for today? Make sure it’s small enough to be able to deploy something asap, while still being compelling. As an excellent example, please see Andrei’s demo from the time he successfully spearfilled Eleven Labs.


5. Compose a short email a la “Here is a properly scoped internship project and here is the Day One output. Are you interested in seeing Day Two?”. You can see an excellent example email here. 

Show your email to another student and an instructor (the fastest way to do this is to post to Discord). Edit and send.
