# Value Worksheet

## Step 1. Revenue Model
- How does the company make money today?  
- How do they want to make money?  

**Special case:** For VC-backed startups, the “revenue” is often fundraising → growth + prestige + hitting next-round metrics.

---

## Step 2. Value Funnel
- List all activities required for the business to generate revenue.  
- Sometimes called a “value funnel,” “marketing funnel,” or “sales funnel.”
- A good example for understanding what is valuable to a business is this 1-page marketing plan, each box is valuable and important:

**Example Funnel:**  
Rent property → Hire instructors → Market program → Qualify leads → Evaluate candidates → Accept candidates → Deliver service → Convert outcomes → Profit

## Step 3. Find the Bottleneck
Look for the step at the intersection of:  
- **A. Needs:** Business really needs it improved (ideally the biggest bottleneck).  
- **B. Obvious Progress:** You can make measurable progress.  
- **C. Gut Check:** It feels important and aligned.

## Step 4. Estimate the Value
Do a **Fermi-style estimate** of the impact:  
- More sales closed?  
- More leads generated?  
- Founder time saved?  
- More “true fans”?  
- New distribution channel unlocked?  

**Always model:** Conservative, Balanced, and Optimistic cases.

---

## Step 5. Price the Value
- Ask for ~**15% of the value created**.  
- If too low → find ways to add more value.  
- If it’s safe-to-fail and motivating for both parties, it’s a good scope.
