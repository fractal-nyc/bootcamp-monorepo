Welcome Coach,

As you know, our goal is to build the greatest engineering community in history.

We called you here to inspire that greatness in our students.

Your job may be historically difficult, but it is straightforward: inspire, push, support, and pull unbelievably good engineering work from your students every day, for 3 months.

In order to do this, you will need to create a sequence of units, lessons, exercises, workshops, guides, writings, experiences, diagrams, explanations, interviews, presentations, motivational speeches, mental moves, and many more such  valuable artifacts. These artifacts should be a distillation of both your lived experience as an engineer and your ambition for your students.

The exercises you design will be exciting, intense, varied, [layered](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLZK_34Oer9LwuqAv-pqxfXlR8n7V8zJ_MO323R7egI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.mqqyz5mwv4br), cool, curious. They will incorporate [practical engineering wisdom](https://grugbrain.dev/), well-supported [learning science](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LLZK_34Oer9LwuqAv-pqxfXlR8n7V8zJ_MO323R7egI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.447z8624tjpw), community resources like mentors and external speakers, and meta-cognitive and meta-emotional tools to handle the difficulty of our program.
