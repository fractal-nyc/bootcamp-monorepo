_Note: we did not end up running this speedrun. And if we use it in the future, it definitely needs a copy edit_

# Purpose:

The Purpose of this Internship Speedrun is to:



1. **Teach you how to bootstrap your own career opportunities from scratch.** Doing this now with 2-week, unpaid internships will be “easy mode”, compared to asking for paid work, which we will do by week 12.
2. **Scale the internship process **-- we are approaching the limit of our abilities to centrally acquire internships across such a diverse cohort. There are 21 of you, all with different skillsets, personalities, and taste. At this point, we can’t get you all internships that are as high quality as the ones you can get yourself. And even if we can, by teaching you, as well, we will have at least 21 MORE opportunities.
3. **Teach you that you can just do things, strategically**. Which is an invaluable skill in the new tech industry. As AI begins to automate most implementation details, marketing strategy becomes increasingly important. Founding Engineers need to know how to [“solve for distribution”](https://visakanv.com/marketing/solve-for-distribution/). That starts with distributing yourself! :)

1.  Link your resume in the [class list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rAIcNdHEraExtdQQkaF6ecl9NneB9uWsIDLrWPgC89o/edit?usp=sharing).
2.  Use the [ELITE CV TRANSFORMATION WIZARD](https://github.com/fractal-bootcamp/bootcamp-monorepo/blob/main/career/ELITE_CV_TRANSFORMATION.md) prompt to dramatically improve your CV (remember Natalie’s workshop!).


# Github



1. Polish your Github
* Good profile pic - can use the same one from LinkedIn

* Pin two of your best projects
2. Link your resume in the [class list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rAIcNdHEraExtdQQkaF6ecl9NneB9uWsIDLrWPgC89o/edit?usp=sharing).


# Portfolio



1. Link your portfolio site in the [class list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rAIcNdHEraExtdQQkaF6ecl9NneB9uWsIDLrWPgC89o/edit?usp=sharing).


# Twitter



1.  Make a Twitter account if you haven’t already. This is really key for networking in the tech industry. Link your twitter in [class list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rAIcNdHEraExtdQQkaF6ecl9NneB9uWsIDLrWPgC89o/edit?usp=sharing).
2.  Add a profile photo and bio. Don’t overthink your bio, give yourself a 5 minute time limit. Do mention that you’re a software engineer.
3.  Link to your website and add your location. If you’re looking for jobs in specific cities, just list those cities. For example, you can say “NY/SF” if you’re seeking jobs in both places.

Again, don’t overthink this, you can always write a new one tomorrow and pin that. Just one step forward. \

5.  Write your first twitter thread or long post. 

I’d recommend taking your best blog post, and then either copying it into a long post (which requires paying for Twitter+), or breaking it into a twitter thread (which is free).

If you have not recorded a demo video, please use Loom to record one.

We will be publicizing these via Twitter and to our email list and elsewhere! Please be careful not to break your demos. You might feel like no one is paying attention to them, but we will be continually sending people to them for the next ~weeks. If you improve them, DO NOT PUSH TO PRODUCTION UNLESS YOU’RE SURE YOU WON’T BREAK IT. 


# Fractal Tech Discord



1.  Change your name & photo in the [Fractal Tech Discord](https://discord.gg/RDPkR7vZ) (different from the Fractal Bootcamp Discord) to your real name and a real photo.
2.  Re-introduce yourself on the [Fractal Tech Discord](https://discord.gg/RDPkR7vZ) #intros channel. 

How you introduce yourself is up to you since I don’t want it to be too copy-pasta since you’ll all be posting there. But I’d recommend writing a few friendly sentences about yourself. You can link to your demo or something else impressive. But also mention at least one non-work thing like what you do for fun. 

END WITH A CALL TO ACTION. The best call to action in the Discord might be a specific ask for introductions, or for feedback on your project. It can also be a social ask like “play tennis with me.” Spending time with anyone who is in the Fractal Tech Discord is probably worth it since many are employed at companies you’d like! (and if it sucks just don’t meet again). Asking for a job directly probably isn’t that effective considering y’all will be posting and there are other job seekers in the discord.

This is actually helpful long-term. One thing that often happens in a large Discord is that someone will raise their hand to say they’re interested in a job or volunteering or an open room, but it’s difficult to tell who they are and whether they’re trustworthy. The natural thing to do if you’re the chooser/hirer/etc is to then search “from:[name]” and see if you can find out more info about them. If you have a clear friendly intro, this makes all future messages in the Discord more powerful.
