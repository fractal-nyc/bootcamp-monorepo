# Overall Curriculum:

- Go from 1 week of intense, hour-to-hour, lesson-by-lesson plan (Week 1, TicTacToe) to 3 weeks!
- Some Stuff We Want To Cover in First 3 Weeks:
    - Abstraction
    - Engineering 101
    - **Systems of The Web**
    - One, consistent, opinionated tech stack
        - EncoreTS backend (or some other typed backend)
        - React & React Router Frontend
    - Diagrams
        - (Client-Server Architecture)
        - Authentication Systems
        - Data & Caching
    - Separation of Concerns
    - Later, after mastery, introduce some alternative tech stacks as required just because you can learn stuff quickly.
- Quick Sketch:
    - Week 1:  TicTacToe
        - React, Typescript, Styling, Server-Client Architecture, Databases & ORMS, Deployment, WebSockets
        - Promises & Async/Await
        - Data & V = F(S)
        - React Router & Client-side Routing // Navigation // URLs
    - Week 2: More Mechanics
    - Week 3: Hackathon
    - Week 4: Engineering 101 -
        - Engineering Design Process
        - Separation of Concerns
        - Modeling abstract systems in language using variables (Advent of Code)
        - We are picking simple SYSTEMS. Not "math problems".
            - Once you master modeling and separation of concerns and such on a SIMPLE system, we can upgrade the complexity
            - to more and more complex systems
        - This is the ANTI-LIBRARY unit; you are learning to build things without libraries; no libraries!
        - So maybe we just directly write Assembly ??
        - Leetcode/Neetcode/Complexity/Scaling
            - Timed back-to-back leetcode easys with immediate feedback.
            - Drills
            - We are drilling abstract modeling; you must be able to IMMEDIATELY model a system in your head.
            - This is a skill!
            - Advent of Code could be the right tool for this due to a layer of abstraction on the problems
            - Maybe work through neetcode but with word problems that Paris and Andrew build to be solved in order back to back
                - good example is twoSum. Students should be able to recognize that two sum is O(n) in their body even if they can't imagine using a hashmap to index information as you map over it.
            - Interviewing each other and critiqueing each other's process
            - Recording yourself solving the problem and watching back the recording
    - Week 5: Group Project




## Retro Notes:
# Bootcamp Feedback

## Rockets (zoom zoom this was op)

### Most important Sauce:
- Treating students as fundamentally creative; learning via creativity
- High expectations (and continuously much higher!)
  - Stress and Enjoyment seem to go together if we can handle the emotions
- Blog posts
- Pre-written guides and practice assignments when people got stuck
- Eugene lectures on how to use AI / Cursor
- Emotional Coaching w/ Mark
- Large cohort size
- Actually completing the precourse material
- Normalization
- Lectures on-demand rather than required
- Detailed but not prescriptive assignments
- Working on stuff people found intrinsically motivating (their website, games)
- Conceptual overviews like diagrams/charts
- Delegate material instruction to readings and videos
- React and Typescript feels like a pretty universal toolkit - could use it to complete ~all assignments

## Turtles (fuck this it slowed us down, get beleted)

### Top Priorities for Next Time:
- **Engineering 101**
  - Debugging
  - Self Unblocking (series of skills)
  - Systematic Thinking (OODA loops)
  - Engineering Process
  - Collaboration & Separation of Concerns
- **Systems of The Web**
  - One, consistent, opinionated tech stack
    - EncoreTS backend (or some other typed backend)
    - React & React Router Frontend
  - Diagrams
    - (Client-Server Architecture)
    - Authentication Systems
    - Data & Caching
  - Later, after mastery, introduce some alternative tech stacks as required just because you can learn stuff quickly.
- **We don't have enough content; web dev is too easy???**
- Ease & Anxiety seem to go together
  - Get rid of everything easy
- Interruptions & Competing Priorities
- Slow mandatory lectures
- Manual review of EOD status reports every day
- Not enough readings, not enough reading culture, not enough textbooks/blog posts/learning from the best
- Generally not enough philosophy or coherent system of values. Would be good to have a giant like "50 pieces of advice for aspiring engineers"
- NextJS is bad and confusing
  - No seriously it made people MORE confused at first
- Not enough meta-cognition // engineering-process
  - Need an "engineering 101" lecture or two in week 1
  - Need a "debugging 101"
  - Need a "how to work 101"
  - ^ these types of things
  - Need a "system design 101"
  - Self unblocking
  - Who is the best in the world at systematically teaching self-unblocking?? Joe Hudson? ASU Engineering 101
  - Do some DEEP RESEARCH etc…
- Changing direction (esp week 1 and 2) was very confusing
- No unit/prep for git
- Did not have a clear escalation scheme for help at first (e.g. ask yourself first, then google, then chatgpt, then #help, then flag us down)
- 20% of students took 80% of my time (at first)
- Varying levels of prep work completion. Some were js/ts pros, others had clearly not done the homework, hard to teach both at once
- #readings #practice #eod code reviews… we didn't enforce or maintain these systems well and they mostly fell by the wayside
  - There's still time! (they were useful in week 1 / 2 tho)
- Precourse material not yet perfect for prep, we especially need to introduce:
  - Typescript
  - SQL
  - ?? maybe that's it??
  - Some inspirational talks (?)
