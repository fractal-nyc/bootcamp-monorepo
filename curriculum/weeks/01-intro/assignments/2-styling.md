### Some notes:

- Download the [Tailwind CSS extension](https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items/?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) in VSCode for autocomplete/intellisense on styles
- The [Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) are very good, very easy to search.
- if you are annoyed by writing a bunch of "if" statements to merge tailwind styles by hand, AND frustrated that you don't get autocomplete, consider using [clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)
