# Multi-Client Game

## Lecture Code

## Overview

Make your simple game multi-client. You should be able to play on multiple computers/browser which talk to each other. You’ll need to add a way to discover games that have only one person, manage “connection state” on the server, and sync game state between server and multiple clients.

## Core Concepts

- Algorithms
- Data Structures
- React & express
