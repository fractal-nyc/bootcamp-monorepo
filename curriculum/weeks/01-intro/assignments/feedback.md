Day 1:
 - pedagogy good, logsitics were tricky
 - people are constantly tripping over git

Day 2:
 - why are we doing a 1hr boring lecture on styling. find a good video on iterative styling
 - also have a video on the box model
 - lecture to introduce concepts. required: clsx / tailwind / css / media queries / themes
 - outcomes: flex, box model, layout, can use tailwindcss

 Day 3:
  - server/client is hard
  - useQuery/useMutation gave everyone a lot of trouble. either justify it more or don't teach it
  - lots of divergence by this point
    - a few students already at lobbying, many students making slow progress, a few struggling

Day 4:
  - fast students probably need to be entertained with polling/websockets but its' too much for slow students
