Day 1:
 - pedagogy good, logsitics were tricky
 - people are constantly tripping over git

Day 2:
 - why are we doing a 1hr boring lecture on styling. find a good video on iterative styling
 - also have a video on the box model
 - lecture to introduce concepts. required: clsx / tailwind / css / media queries / themes
 - outcomes: flex, box model, layout, can use tailwindcss

 Day 3:
  - server/client is hard
  - useQuery/useMutation gave everyone a lot of trouble. either justify it more or don't teach it
  - lots of divergence by this point
    - a few students already at lobbying, many students making slow progress, a few struggling

Day 4:
  - fast students probably need to be entertained with polling/websockets but its' too much for slow students

Day 5:
  - Janick: docs say to run `drizzle-kit push`, you ABSOULTELY should not
  - drizzle docs kinda suck in general tbh
  - Janick says his little pod is constantly tossing ideas amongst each other
    - this seems really powerful. not sure if this is good or bad
    - makes these guys faster, but maybe also keeps the slow ppl slower?
    - do we need to intentionally mix ppl? or is this actually working as designed

  - maddie said we should have a small unit on how to read docs or showing how its done

JY feedback:
  - I used to run a coaching business and getting pointed feedback for them was important
  - Not sure who is the target audience, but if the goal is a brand new student, my thoughts:
  - Good:
    - Love that you guys are checking in on us daily, more of that
    - Proactively reaching out the students behind and regrouping felt extremely supportive
    - People like being told they're behind when it means we can name it & develop a plan
    - "How to not use chatgpt badly" was extremely helpful - Andrew did this, Paris did this in the lounge
  - Bad:
    - Precourse was very different: the 3 week "essentials" precourse did not feel like preparation at all for day 1
    - I bascially crammed over 2 weeks, I thought I understood, but there was just too much
    - I was basically planning on quitting after day 1 because I was so overwhelmed
    - (paris note: maybe we should do end-of-day checkin on day 1?)
    - Big missing piece: typescript/advanced syntax, cuz react uses it (destructuring, props, etc)
    - Need to voice that the goal is learning a ton, not shipping, because im super produ of my learning, but not the shipping
    - First day: having to socialize is super overwhelming (note: maybe we can make it mildly optional or focus it on dinner only)
