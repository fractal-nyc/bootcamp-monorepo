Andrew Delivers Lecture:

Goal of these notes:
1. Provide a guide for other instructors to verify I'm covering everything that I said I was gonna cover
2. Provide a set of things I'm gonna cover so that we can verify we have everything in the curriculum for that week.
3. A rough script if one of us is sick or we do this again.
4. Notes to enhance the experience:
    - Cold-calling
    - Jokes
    - Scripts
    - Videos, or Memes, or whatever
5. Printouts, Cheat Sheets, Readings, Quizzes; anything I need to cover at the beginning of lecture.
