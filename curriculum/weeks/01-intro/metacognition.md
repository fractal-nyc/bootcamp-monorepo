### Meta-Lesson: name all of our lessons and turn them into little exercises!


# Lessons to Teach:


## How to LEARN BETTER?

1. What is expertise? How can you notice it? How can you pay attention to it? What will happen if you pay attention to it?
- Goal: open up the black box of "mental moves" that are being performed


2. AMATEUR vs EXPERT problem-solving
- Amateur: 1-step 'what is the solution' + body posture + tools + how can you notice this?
- Expert: 100-steps 'what is one thing I know about the solution?


3. What are the mental moves that productive engineers do?
- What are all of the waypoints in between "here is a problem" and "here is the solution to the problem"? What are all the intermediate steps?
- Algorithmic thinking (Check Out Computer Science K-12, and also maybe some Math Puzzles)


4. Mission Control:
Step 1 - Define Goal
Step 2 - Articulate State
Step 3 - Name Options
Step 4 - Select + Act
Step 5 - State What Happened
Step 6 - REPEAT


5. Scientist:
(related to debugging)
- "How do we gain knowledge via experimentation?"
- "Debugging is when your model of the system and the system itself have diverged, and need to converge again. It is about learning how to accurately model a system quickly."
- (Julia Evans' guide to debugging)
Step 1 - Notice Something Unexpected
Step 2 - Isolate the Anomaly As Tightly As Possible (from the rest of the system)
Step 3 - Notice your assumptions (especially about the state)
Step 4 - List/state core assumptions, in order of confidence/influence
Step 5 - Test the most relevant assumptions

6. Articulate The Problem:
- Notice what is going on
- Say what the problem is


## How to FEEL BETTER?

- Signpost this stuff in week 1


Goals: 
- Help people unpack their narratives in programming (and all sub-narratives), and have intentional narrative control over that story.
- Help people unpack their narratives with respect to work, and have intentional narrative control over that story.
- People re-evaluate their narratives of themselves into ones that are much more aligned with reality (converge their believed underlying stories with things that are aligned with reality)




1. Focusing Game:
(step-by-step game)


## Goal: Converge Student Stories with Reality

1. They need to know what reality is like

Stories:
- Virginia Valian (Solving a Work Problem)

Facts:
- "everything you are doing is completely understandable and tractable and you can understand every bit of it."
- "all humans can get better at things very quickly"

2. They need to know what their stories are
- "what is your personal story as you understand it now?"
- A diagnostic // and existing psychometric diagnostics:
    - "I believe I can solve Novel Problems"
- Sleepawake stuff, for instance:

3. They need tools to change their stories




### Stuff We Should Layer Into the Curriculum:



### Mental Moves:
1. Make sure I have an extremely precise understanding of the algorithm before I start coding.
