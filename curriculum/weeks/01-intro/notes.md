### Things to Improve:


# Day 1 - Simple Game:
- Day 1 was really good! Just keep up the energy and try to have like 4:1 student-teacher ratio if possible
- It can feel like a festival or something

# Day 2 - Styling:
- We need a good tutorial for pixel-perfect styling in TailwindCSS
- There is probably a good YouTube video
- But also just writing our own markdown guide is probably fine, as well.


# Day 3 - Server:
- We can't teach RPC / API Clients if we aren't going to teach Abstraction as a principle

Overall:
- The way we taught sockets was way too complicated; there is a simple version.
- We didn't actually have an agreed upon "good" approach to the problem, so we had some unnecessarily complicated approaches.
- We ripped out ViteExpress
-
