# APIs

Morning

- `curl`, the terminal, and shell scripting
- Third-party APIs, API keys, and .env variables
- `bun create vite-express`
- NodeJS `fetch`
- Anthropic NodeJS SDK
- Messages API is stateless, so you have to include the entire conversation history.

Afternoon:

- Shadcn components, one level of abstraction up from Tailwind.
- Even though Claude is good at CSS, these components can give you a head start and let you move even faster.
