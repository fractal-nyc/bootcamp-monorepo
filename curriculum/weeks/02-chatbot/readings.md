**Note:** for practice this week, I have assigned a lot of optional work. It's up to you to decide if you need to do this work, and if you do, you should do it in addition to your regular work.

If you aren't sure, I recommend doing 30min -> 1hr of practice. If you aren't consistently getting the quizzes right, you probably have some pratice to do.

Practice WILL help with **memorization** and **concept mastery**, which WILL reduce cognitive load and improve your performance and literacy when coding.
