# Week 4: RAISE YOUR AMBITIONS Challenge & Agentic Engineering Unleashed

**For:** Fractal Tech Cohort
**Starting:** Monday, Feb 23, 2026

---

## The Brief

Build something you believe might be literally impossible — something so cool that if you could pull it off, it would blow you away. You have no idea how you'd do it. That's the point. The project should push you beyond your current capabilities, and you should accomplish something NEW that you have never done before, either via scale or technology.

Again, we want you at the edge of what you think is possible.

## What You Need to Do

### Submit a Pitch

Before you start building, create a short written pitch (a PRD or equivalent). We need to know what you're working on. You can start exploring on your own, but the pitch is required. If you're struggling with this, ask Claude Code to research what a good PRD looks like, and what problems it might help you to avoid.

Your pitch should cover:

- **What you're building** — a clear description of the project
- **What new technology or skill you are implementing** — highlight the specific technology, framework, platform, tool, or scale of project that is new to you
- **How this pushes beyond what you think is possible** — where are you stretching? What part of this excites you?

### Build It

Spend the week building. Be ambitious about using Claude Code as a tool to understand and improve your codebase. Each PR Claude should improve. Each PR you should improve. You and your harness should be accelerating and improving together, ala Atin's Agentic Engineering or our Compound Engineering.

### Present Your Work

At the end of the week, we will demo.

## The Philosophy

Last week proved that every one of you can design and ship great projects. Now we're raising the bar again!

You've shown you can build with taste. Now show us you can grow, and that you can use Agentic Engineering to go further than you think possible.

---

## What Makes a Good Pitch

- It's ambitious enough that you're not sure you can pull it off
- It involves a technology or domain that is genuinely new to you
- It's specific — not "learn AI" but "build Isometric NYC but for the entire lunar surface" (or whatever)
- It has a deliverable — something you can demo at the end of the week

## What We Don't Want

- Projects that stay in your comfort zone
- Vague ideas without a concrete plan
- Pure tutorials repackaged as projects — you should be building something original, not following a guide

## Agentic Engineering Improvement Challenges

NOTE: None of these are meant to be a final solution. They're meant to get you tinkering with your harness so that you achieve a state of unlimited flow. The computer should get out of your way so you can just express fluid creativity and productivity. In the dream world, you could get 20 agents to simultaneously build all your projects for you, so you could just aim EVEN HIGHER and do EVEN HARDER things after you're done.

Ideally, the thing you thought would take you all week can actually be one-shotted with the right skills, and then you're forced to revise your plan.

### Build an Always-On "Hot Mic"

Follow this installation guide to set up an always-on "hot mic" that transcribes everything you say to your computer. It runs entirely locally using Whisper AI. You can change all of it — the trigger phrases, the sensitivity, the model, everything.

Once it's running, start experimenting with prompting Claude entirely hands-free. Talk to it. Get Claude to explain how the system works — it's all local, it's all changeable, and Claude can walk you through every piece of it.

[Installation guide](https://gist.github.com/ajroberts0417/e095d950fe345648237685fe94242823)

### Install Wispr Flow

Install [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/) for talking to Claude. It's voice-to-text that works across your whole computer. You talk, it writes. Try using it for everything — Claude, Slack, docs, code comments. See what happens when typing is no longer the bottleneck.

---

### Set Up Agentic Engineering

Look at Atin's [Agentic Engineering](https://github.com/AuthenticTechnology/Agentic-Engineering) repo. It's how a small startup treats AI agents as compounding engineering teammates.

Try using it or creating your own version. Add a global and project-level `CLAUDE.md` for your ambitious project this week. Try theirs, and then make it your own.

---

### Install Lattice

Try [Lattice](https://thelattice.works/) for agentic project management. It's a file-based coordination system that lives in your repo — agents can pick up tasks, transition them, and hand things back to you.

When you install it, try asking Claude to read the Lattice website and install it for itself. Ask Claude to write you a guide explaining how Lattice works — with diagrams. Or ask it to build you an interactive tutorial.

If you run into bugs or it doesn't work, consider shipping a pull request to improve it.

### Use /context and analyze where your context is going.


### Check out and experiment with some good skills which might help you improve your projects (https://skills.sh)

None of these are "the answer". But they're starting points, and clues toward a setup that works for YOU. The point is to keep tinkering — keep adjusting how you work with the computer until it disappears and all that's left is the thing you're building. If something gets in your way, fix it. If a tool doesn't fit, change it or build something better.

Go way beyond what you would normally be capable of.
