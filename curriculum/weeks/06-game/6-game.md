# Group Game Project

You will work in groups of 1-3 people to build a fully-featured game.

The technologies and platform you choose are up to you. Some ideas:

 - Use React and Websockets to build a game (like [BoardGameArena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/))
 - Real time, in-browser, 3D games using [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
 - If you're feeling ambitous, use a real game engine like [Unity](https://unity.com/) to make a fully-featured game distributed via the [Web Player](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/webgl.html)

 ## Requirements
  - Work as a team, with good division of labor; make commits to the same repo and review PRs
  - Must be able to be played by an instructor's laptop or phone by saturday
  - Use AI for both development and asset creation as needed
  - Must be high quality and polished by Saturday; this is going into your portfolio!

## Rough Plan

- Monday: Come up with some ideas, form groups, come up with high level plan
- Tuesday: Build a prototype of the basic features
- Wednesday: basic play-testing
- Thursday: adding more content/features
- Friday: polish
- Saturday: demos
