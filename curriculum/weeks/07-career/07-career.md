# Week 7: Interview / Career Sprint

The first half of this accelerator was all about building the skills to ship experiences fast. The second half is all about polish, deepening expertise, and landing a job. We're going to develop a strong foundation for job-hunting this week that you will use (and iterate on) for the rest of the problem and then for the rest of your career.
## Outcomes

This week, you need to build assets that actually help you get hired. that means:
 - have a personalized, step-by-step plan for finding a job
 - a portfolio that looks like it belongs to someone already in the field
    - this means the projects need to be professional quality. you will probably spend
    significant time polishing them so they're ready.
 - feel comfortable on all the possible interview formats
    - leetcode, basic system design, take-homes, soft skills/culture interview
 - start hunting for an internship/job with all of these tools, alongside any other work you do (like capstones)

## Rough Schedule:

Unlike previous weeks, we won't structure exactly what happens when. Many of us are out on internships and cannot be in the office for lectures or in-person activities. You will be working on all 3 of the things listed above as you get time throughout the week. Here's a rough guideline on when to read resources and make plans:

 - Monday: come up with [a job search plan](./assignments/01-job-search-plan.md)
 - Tuesday: practice [soft skills interviews](./assignments/02-soft-skills.md)
 - Wednesday: [Polished resume + portfolio + website](./assignments/03-portfolio.md)
 - Thursday: [Grind Leetcode](./assignments/04-leetcode.md)
 - Friday: [System Design Primer](./assignments/05-system-design-primer.md)
 - Saturday: We will run an interview-a-thon!
