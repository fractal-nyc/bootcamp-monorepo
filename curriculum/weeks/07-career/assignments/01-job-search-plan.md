# Job Search Planning

Write a 1-2 page job search plan. By the end of the day, you should:
 - know what kinds of companies you’re targeting (and why)
 - know how you’ll get in front of them (channels, intros, cold outreach)
 - have a clear story for why they should hire you
 - commit to weekly activities that compound your odds

## Advice

The overarching goal is to put yourself in as many environments where you stand out as possible. As job-seekers with no experience, it's very difficult to differentiate yourself from the mass. You only need to find one person who is interested by what makes you unique.

### No Resume Blenders
At the entry level these don't work any more. HR recieves 500 applications for every role. They can't read those manually, so they use automated filters. They use these filters poorly. They also filter for things like "degree" which most of you don't have. Even if you have gotten past the resume filters, there's nothing to materially distinguish your resume from others. Who gets an interview will be effectively random.

If you're going to use online job applications, make sure the platform is highly targeted. Here are some good options:
 - [wellfound.com](http://wellfound.com)
 - [builtin.com](http://builtin.com)
 - [Workatastartup](https://workatastartup.com/)
 - [Buildlist](https://www.buildlist.xyz/) - work at a company building real things

### Hiring Manager Mindset
 - Hiring is risky
 - Career pivots look risky - get ahead of that ("i'm being intentional, this is my passion, etc")
 - people expect "your best behavior"/story, not your "authentic" self

### Prepare an extremely clear story

Your portfolio website is the strongest tool you have to show who you are and the quality of your work. Make sure it is in excellent shape. Come up with a story about yourself and why you're here. You have 30 seconds to tell a possible employer what you're about and why you're different. Rehearse this story.

### Use Your Network

A warm introduction puts you clearly ahead of everyone else looking for a job. Personal connections are by far the highest quality leads for both employers and job seekers. Use them agressively and don't be afraid to ask others for help.

Here are some VCs we know personally, who might be able to help you get intros into their porfolio companies:
1. [Betaworks](https://www.betaworks.com/companies) - Betaworks likes us, and we know a lot of people there.
2. [South Park Commons](https://www.southparkcommons.com/community) - We can get an intro to SPC companies!
3. [AntlerVC](https://www.antler.co/portfolio) - We host events with Antler, and we have a few students who have worked with their portcos before.
4. [OnDeck](https://www.joinodf.com/)
5. [Techstars NYC](https://www.techstars.com/accelerators/nyc)

If you need someone's email, maybe use the [Apollo Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/apolloio-free-b2b-phone-n/alhgpfoeiimagjlnfekdhkjlkiomcapa?hl=en-US).

### "Microjobs"
Read about [Micromarriages](https://colah.github.io/personal/micromarriages/). There's a similar concept with job-hunting, "microjobs." There's no single action you can take to get a job. But there are 100 actions you can take that all increase your odds of getting a job by 1%.

Things that are worth microjobs:
 - Being rejected
 - Failing an interview
 - Failing a negotiation
 - Being awkward in a call
 - Sending a bad email
If you do these often enough and learn from your mistakes, you will get a job.

### Focus on providing solutions

Make it REALLY EASY for people to say yes. Propose ridiculously below market prices combined with a very competent and well-written email to communicate “I get it. You’re taking a bet, but I’m smart and worth taking a bet on.”

Negotiate someone down to a junior engineering position. Convince someone to make a role for you. (e.g. "let's just start with a contract")

Do not worry about money. This is not just a negotiation tactic. You need to actually understand that the thing that matters is solving the problem for this person. Is someone going to pay you to solve the problem?
 - Show them you can solve the problem
 - Show them you can identify the most important problem
 - Show them you can understand that problem
 - Show them you can make progress on that problem
Then once they’ve decided they want you to solve the problem, you can talk about rates later.


### Find things unique to you
You need to stand out. Obviously, you should highlight obviously strong traits, but consider also any controversial or polarizing traits you might have. You only need one person to like you enough to give you an offer! Bet on finding that person who finds your polarizing traits interesting, not dismaying.

For instance - when Paris was job hunting without a degree, that was a strongly negative signal to most employers. But a certain brand of startup actually sees going without a degree as a _strength_. He focused exclusively on that market of early stage startups when job hunting.

## Structure of your Job Search Plan

Come up with a list of things you'll do to get a job. Tailor them to your strengths and interests. Be creative and don't be afraid to do weird stuff.
It doesn't need to be in this format, but they document should definitely cover:

1. Target Market
    - what kinds of companies are you applying to?
    - what industries?
    - what size? stage? (seed, series A, public?)
    - what tech stack, if it matters to you?
    - why these? what's your edge there?
2. Tactics
    - pick 3-5 repeatable tactics that match your strengths. examples:
    - go to 10 meetups in your city by the end of the month
    - go to 10 industry events by end of the month
    - ask at least 5 potential employers to grab lunch
    - find 3 people in my network who can get me a referral"
    - land another paid internship
    - cold email 5 engineers per week at target companies
    - post 1 technical blog post per week on a topic you've mastered
    - ask 1 friend for a warm intro every week
    - contribute to open source projects used by your target companies
    - hackathons, twitter network, job fairs, tech happy hours, cold emails, blog
3. Your Story
    - what’s your 30-second pitch?
    - what unique background, skills, or values do you bring?
    - what kinds of problems do you want to work on?

## Example plan (very shortened)

target market: seed-stage startups, NYC or remote. mostly b2b saas. using react/node/postgres. i prefer small teams where i can ship fast and touch product. (put example companies)

tactics: cold email 5 founders/week, go to every brooklyn tech meetup in july, publish 2 project breakdowns on my blog

story: i’m a 19‑year‑old valedictorian who ditched college to break into tech. i’ve been obsessed with computers since i was 12 and I love building websites and shipping projects fast. i want to work on teams that value speed, curiosity, and real user impact. I need good mentorship but I'm extremely self-directed.

weekly cadence: 10 hrs/week. mondays for outreach, wednesdays for mock interviews, fridays for follow-ups.

## Activities

11:00am: draft your "elevator pitch"

11:45am: pair off and practice delivering your elevator pitch

12:30pm: lunch break, then write up a career plan

4:30pm: peer reviews on rough career plan drafts
