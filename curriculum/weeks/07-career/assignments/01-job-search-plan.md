## Some Advice

The overarching goal is to put yourself in as many environments where you stand out as possible. As job-seekers with no experience, it's very difficult to differentiate yourself from the mass. You only need to find one person who is interested by what makes you unique.

1. Give up on "Resume Blenders" like Linkedin
    - At the entry level these don't work any more. HR recieves 500 applications for every role. They can't read those manually, so they use automated filters. They use these filters poorly. They also filter for things like "degree" which most of you don't have.
    - Even if you have gotten past the resume filters, there's nothing to materially distinguish your resume from others. Who gets an interview will be effectively random.
    - If you can't resist: https://www.workatastartup.com/, wellfound.com, builtin.com
2. Prepare an extremely clear story
    - Your portfolio website is the strongest tool you have to show who you are and the quality of your work. Make sure it is in excellent shape.
    - Come up with a story about yourself and why you're here. You have 30 seconds to tell a possible employer what you're about and why you're different. Rehearse this story.
3. Use your network
    - A warm introduction puts you clearly ahead of everyone else looking for a job. Personal connections are by far the highest quality leads for both employers and job seekers. Use them agressively and don't be afraid to ask others for help.
4. "Micromarriages"
    - Read about [Micromarriages](https://colah.github.io/personal/micromarriages/). There's a similar concept with job-hunting, "microjobs." There's no single action you can take to get a job. But there are 100 actions you can take that all increase your odds of getting a job by 1%.
5. Find things unique to you
    - You need to stand out. Obviously, you should highlight obviously strong traits, but consider also any controversial or polarizing traits you might have. You only need one person to like you enough to give you an offer! Bet on finding that person who finds your polarizing traits interesting, not dismaying.
    - For instance - when Paris was job hunting without a degree, that was a strongly negative signal to most employers. But a certain brand of startup actually sees going without a degree as a _strength_. He focused exclusively on that market of early stage startups when job hunting.
6. Make a clear plan
    - Come up with a list of things you'll do to get a job. Tailor them to your strengths and interests. Be creative and don't be afraid to do weird stuff.
    - Some ideas: industry meetups, networking events, hackathons, job fairs, happy hours, tapping your Twitter network, sending (thoughtful!) old emails, creating content bait on your blog on personal projects
    - Set some goals for yourself and spend tailored time each week from here on out working on hitting them. 
    - Focus on "microjobs", not outcomes. "Go to 10 hackathons" is a good goal, "get a job" or "get 2 interviews" is not. Examples:
        - "Go to 10 industry events by end of the month"
        - "Ask at least 5 potential employers to grab lunch"
        - "Find 3 people in my network who can get me a referral"
        - "Land another paid internship"
        - "Cold email 10 early stage startups"
