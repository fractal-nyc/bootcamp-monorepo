# Soft Skills Interview

Most candidates think the soft skills interview is about proving they are nice or easy to work with, but that’s not quite it. You’re being tested on whether you can communicate clearly, handle uncomfortable questions, and project confidence inside the constraints of a professional setting. It's hard to fail this interview, but
it often serves as a tiebreaker. If there's two candidates with similar technical ability, the one who communicates better and feels easier to work with wins.

# Some Advice

## Use STAR

See the Cracking the Coding Interview example. STAR is by far the best format for nailing this interview. 

## Prep stories
Prepare ~3-5 stories that collectively cover most of [the most common soft skills interview questions](https://devskiller.com/blog/45-behavioral-questions-to-use-during-non-technical-interview-with-developers/). These stories should be rehearsed but not memorized; you want to seem free-flowing, spontaneous, and authentic during the interview.

## Control the  Narrative

Some people get tripped over being too honest, accurate, or thorough in these interviews. It's OK not to mention every detail, or to simplify things for the flow of the story. Remember, you are selling yourself and your interviewer knows it. You don't need to be a super even handed objective narrator. This interview is _directly and intentionally_ testing your ability to sell yourself.

## Handle Loaded Questions

Questions like “what’s your greatest weakness?” aren’t really about the weakness. They’re about whether you can handle a tricky prompt with poise. Your answer should acknowledge a real but non-fatal weakness, show that you’ve built systems to handle it, and end on a confident note.

 # Rough Schedule

 Morning: brainstorm and draft 3-5 stories with a few STAR responses to example questions
