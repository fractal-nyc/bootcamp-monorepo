# Soft Skills Interview

The soft skills interview is an important component of most interview panels. Although the technical portion is likely more important, making a strong impression in the soft skills interview is critical to landing a job and often acts as a "tiebreaker" between two candidates.

# Some Advice

Prepare 3 tight-knit stories that can serve to answer multiple questions. Make them compelling, interesting, and adaptable to the question at hand. 

Some people get tripped over being too honest, accurate, or thorough in these interviews. It's OK not to mention every detail, or to simplify things for the flow of the story. Remember, you are selling yourself and your interviewer knows it. You don't need to be a super even handed objective narrator. This interview is _directly and intentionally_ testing your ability to sell yourself.

Practice these in front of somebody. Practicing in your own head is insufficient. We will do this during class.

Despite what this interview _claims_ to be, I (Paris) don't think the goal is to provide examples of your soft skills. I think this interview is testing your ability to communicate clearly under business/HR constraints. This might be a controversial take. Consider the question "what is your greatest weakness?" DO NOT ANSWER THIS DIRECTLY. If you say "I have trouble organizing tasks, sometimes I use a list but it's hard" you will fail this interview. Instead, you should have prepared an answer that highlights a real weakness you're aware of, but succinctly explains how you account for it. The "test" is that you noticed the format, noticed that they're asking a question that puts you in an uncomfortable position, prepared an answer beforehand, and you've figured out a way to gracefully communicate a complicated sentiment in a clear and confident way. This models the way you will communicate about projects/teammates/goals in the business environment.
