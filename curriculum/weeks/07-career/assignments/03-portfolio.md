# Portfolio and Resume

Your portfolio is your main ambassador. Your resume is a supporting artifact. Together they make the first impression; make that impression count!

Today, you should have a really strong document footprint of yourself:
 - a strong personal website, hosted on a real domain
 - a portfolio on that website showing professional-quality work
    - if your projects aren't professional quality yet, you've got some work to do :)
 - a clear, 1-page resume

You should feel comfortable showing all of these to your future employer by the end of the week and ideally end of the day.

## Portfolio

Your portfolio must look like it belongs to someone already in the field. You have ~30 seconds to convince someone you can build real things.
Your portfolio should make someone think: *this person ships real things and takes pride in their work.*

**What to include**
- 1–2 projects you are proud of
- a short blurb about what value you bring and what makes you unique
- live demos if possible. if not, clear screenshots or a short video
- links to code (github or similar)
- 2–3 sentences on each project: what it does, why you built it, tech used, etc

**What good looks like**
- obvious navigation
- clear visuals and descriptions; I should know what you did within 30 seconds
- fast load times

**What bad looks like**
- five mediocre projects instead of one great one.
- “creative” layouts that hide your work.
- walls of text with no images or links.
- repos with missing readmes or dead links.

## Resume

Resumes don’t win jobs, but you still need one.

**Rules**
- 1 page.
- name, email, github, portfolio link.
- short skills/tech list.
- factual work history in reverse chronological order. role, dates, 1–2 bullets.
- don’t tailor. don’t get cute. this is just a record.

## Activities

**3:00pm:** Portfolio reviews. Open each other’s sites and ask: would I hire this person based on this? Write down fixes.
