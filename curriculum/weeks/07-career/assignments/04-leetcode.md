# Leetcode & Technical Interviews

During your search you will get leetcode-style interview questions. 
If you can get interviews by selling yourself and then do well on the leetcode questions,
you will most certainly eventually land a job. This format is unfortunately artificial, 
but it will keep your programming skills sharp and it's a very neccessary component of
getting a job.

Doing well on these is a combination of a few things:
 - Raw programming skill. You all have enough of this.
 - Pattern recognition. 90% of leetcodes use the same tools and patterns. If you can recognize which one to use quickly, it's hard to fail.
 - Raw practice. It's extremely difficult to think clearly under pressure. The more you practice, the easier that becomes.

# Instructions

## Read CTCI

[Cracking The Coding Interview](https://github.com/club-de-programacion-competitiva/libros/blob/master/Cracking-the-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition-189-Programming-Questions-and-Solutions.pdf) is the interview bible. If you master the material in this book you will definitely pass technical interviews. Read it all if you can. 
 - Must reads: Section I (The Process), IV (Before The Interview), VII (Technical Questions). 
 - Chapter IX (Interview Questions) is the meat of the book and a great overview of the data structures and algorithms available to you.
 - From Chapter IX, prioiritize Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Recursion, Sorting, Searching, and Testing.

## Neetcode

Grind [NeetCode practice problems](https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75). There is no way to get good at leetcode 
without insane amounts of practice. The Blind 75 are a good start, then do the 150 or 250. Use the random problem selection so 
you don't get hints about what the solution might look like. **DO NOT USE AI** and do not use your IDE heavily. In some
interviews, they'll give you something like VSCode, but in others, you'll just be given raw text files. So you need to be comfortable
not using your IDE.

## Goals

Bare minimum to get a job:
 - Able to do ~100% of Easy, some the fast way (~O(N)), others the slow way (O(N^2) or worse)
 - Able to do 30% of Mediums, mostly the slow way
 - Can't do any Hards, but might make progress
 - If you cannot reach this level, stop your job hunt until you can

Decent:
 - Easily solving all Easy problems the slow way. Able to find the fast way on nearly all of them without working too hard.
 - Solving almost all Mediums the slow way. Able to find the efficient way on some after some thinking.
 - Solving a few Hards, mostly the slow way
 - This should be your goal

 Great:
 - Able to find the efficient solution on all Easy with minimal thinking
 - Solving almost all Medium problems the efficient way with some thinking
 - Solving ~1/3 of Hard problems the efficient way with some thinking
 - At this level you can probably pass Big Tech interviews. If you reach this level, or think you can with some practice, reach out to an instructor.
