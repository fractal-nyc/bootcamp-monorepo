# System Design Primer

As mostly-junior engineers, it's unlikely you will get a true system design interview. You lack the pratical experience
neccessary to talk about tradeoffs and scalability, but having a high level sense of how these systems and designed
and work is important. 

# Instructions

 - Read the [HelloInterview intro to system design](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/in-a-hurry/introduction)
 - Watch or skim a few of the [System Breakdowns](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/problem-breakdowns/uber) in HelloInterview.
    They're pretty realistic and do a good job teaching the high level concepts.
 - Watch a [very realistic mock system design interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suYjr4ekN1c)
   - you will not be able to execute at this level. that's OK -- these are senior/staff engineers
 - Practice a few of the System Breakdowns yourself using a whiteboard

# Schedule:

 - Today, we will run through a couple of system design problems ourselves on a whiteboard.
 - With any remaining time you have, keep grinding leetcode and polishing your website/portfolio as needed.
