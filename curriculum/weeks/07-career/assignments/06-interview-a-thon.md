# Mock technical interviews

## 0–5 min: intro

instructor explains goals: simulate real interview conditions, improve problem solving, and learn to evaluate peers.

quick walkthrough of rubric.

## 5–35 min: individual problem solving

each student picks a random easy/medium neetcode problem.

they work individually for ~30 min.

instructor walks around, ensures no one is stuck too long.

## 35–40 min: prep for interviews

students finish last notes on their solution (can be pseudocode if incomplete).

pair students randomly.

## 40–55 min: round 1 interviews

student A interviews student B using A’s problem.

B explains thought process, writes code on whiteboard or editor while A asks questions and guides.

A uses rubric to score B.

## 55–70 min: round 2 interviews

switch roles.

student B now interviews student A with B’s problem.

same process, same rubric.

## 70–75 min: debrief

quick group discussion: what surprised you, where were you weak as interviewer/candidate, what patterns did you notice?

collect rubrics for review or self‑reflection.

## Rubric

| category | 1 (poor) | 2 (fair) | 3 (good) | 4 (excellent) |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **problem solving approach** | misunderstands problem, no clear plan | partial understanding, weak exploration | solid grasp, some tradeoff analysis | fully understands, explores approaches, justifies choices |
| **correctness & complexity** | incorrect, misses edge cases | mostly correct but gaps, poor complexity | correct with minor issues, reasonable complexity | fully correct, handles edges, optimal complexity |
| **communication & collaboration** | silent, unclear reasoning | some explanation, inconsistent clarity | explains most steps, responsive | clear, continuous reasoning, engages interviewer |
| **code quality & implementation** | messy, buggy, poor structure | basic code, some errors | clean code with minor flaws | well‑structured, idiomatic, minimal bugs |
| **interview dynamics (meta)** | poor time use, no questions | uneven pacing, few clarifications | manages time, asks some questions | excellent pacing, proactive clarifications |
