# How to Succeed at Your Externship

## 1. Mindset: This is Your Audition

Your externship is not a conventional job—it's your audition for the tech industry. Treat it with the intensity and preparation you would bring to any major audition. Some externships are potentially convertible to a full-time position, but even those that are not can be the source of valuable referrals **if you knock it out of the park**.

## 2. Crystal Clear Scope Definition

**Before you start:**
- Have an extremely clear definition of the project scope
- Understand exactly what "done" means
- Document expectations in writing

## 3. Sprint to Over-Deliver

**The power of exceeding expectations:**
- You can sprint for 1-2 weeks—use this to your advantage
- Put in extra hours strategically
- If a project is scoped for 2 weeks, challenge yourself to complete it in 1 week
- This approach creates a "wow" effect that leaves a lasting impression

## 4. Never Stay Blocked

- Never remain blocked for more than one hour
- Immediately communicate if you're stuck or blocked to your manager and to Paris/David/Andrew

## 5. Aggressive Communication

**Proactive updates are your safety net:**
- Send daily (EODs) to the team you're working with in addition to in the Fractal Bootcamp Discord
- Include:
  - List of things accomplished today
  - Current blockers
  - Plans for tomorrow

**Why EODs matter:**
- Demonstrates your productivity
- Creates a paper trail if something goes wrong later
- Documents any blockers you've communicated
- Protects your reputation if things go off track
- Shows consistent progress even if the project faces challenges

## 6. Managing Deviations from Expectations

In Paris's words:
> "If you **tell someone** you're gonna deviate from expectations, that is usually fine. If **you don't tell someone** you're deviating from expectations, you're fucked. They will think you're flaky, unreliable or stupid."

**Best practice:**
- Communicate early and often about any potential delays
- Explain the reasons clearly
- Propose solutions or alternatives

## 7. Always Go In-Person When Possible

If the startup is based in NYC, offer to go work from their office. Face-to-face interaction will make collaboration easier.

# When to Escalate

Escalate to Paris, David, Andrew, or Priya if:
- The externship is going poorly
- You're overwhelmed by factors outside the externship
- The workload is unrealistic
- You're confused about expectations
- You're exhausted and need support

# The Success Formula

Following these principles makes it extremely difficult to fail:

1. **Communicate expectations clearly** ✓
2. **Exceed those expectations consistently** ✓
3. **Communicate proactively when you might miss expectations** ✓
4. **Submit EODs every day** ✓

Even if the project doesn't achieve all its goals, following this framework ensures you leave a positive impression.
