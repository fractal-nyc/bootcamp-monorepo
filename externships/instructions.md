# How to Do An Externship

## Prepare for the Kickoff

The kickoff meeting is your opportunity to understand the externship project and set yourself up for success. You’ll have 30 minutes to clarify everything you need to know about the project, so preparation is critical.

**1. Visit the company’s official website.** Try to get a clear sense of what the company does and who its customers are.
<br>**2. Research the Founder or Employees.** Look up the founder(s) or key team members on LinkedIn.
<br>**3. Read the Ticket Carefully — Twice** You should be able to find this in the calendar invite. 
Tickets vary — some are detailed, others vague. This is normal in real-world work: the person assigning it may still be clarifying their own thinking. Your job is to ask constructive questions that help them refine the problem and give you the context you need to succeed.
<br>**4. Write Out a List of Questions** Before the kickoff, draft a list of questions to bring to the meeting.
These should help you uncover:
- The desired outcome (What does success look like?)
- The end user (Who are you building for?)
- The scope (What’s included, what’s not?)
- The technical environment (What stack, repo, or tools are being used?)
- The review process (Who reviews your work, and how often?)
- What you need access to for the project - i.e. a codebase, figma files, etc.

Don’t worry about having “too many” questions — it’s much better to ask them early than to guess later.
<br>**5. Make sure you have an AI transcriber for the kickoff meeting.** 
[Granola](https://www.granola.ai/), [Otter](https://otter.ai/home), or [Fathom](https://www.fathom.ai/) are good choices. 
If you don't usually use an AI notetaker, please set one up now and do a test run with a friend.

## At the Kickoff

**You will lead the kickoff.**

**0. Arrive 2 minutes early.** 
<br>**1. Introduce yourself.** You don't need to give too much context here, just be enthusiastic. "Hi, I'm [name], I'm really excited to work on this project because [X]. How are you today?"
<br>**2. Set the agenda.** Something like: "My plan is to ask you a bunch of questions about the ticket to make sure I understand the work and can get started on this right away. Does that sound good? Is there anything else you want to do on this call?"
<br>**3. Ask your questions.** Ask questions until you understand the ticket and have access to any resources you need.
<br>**4. Thank them and tell them next steps.** "Thank you so much for the context. 
I am going to write up a doc with everything we just discussed and send it over to you by the end of the day.
I'll also get started on the project and reach out to you if I need anything else."

Someone from Fractal Tech will be on the call with you (i.e. Priya, Andrew, Paris, David, or Andy) and can step in if needed. We're also there to make sure the scope doesn't get out of hand, and to invervene if the company has unrealistic expectations or bad vibes.

## Immediately After the Kickoff

Write a ~1 page document with everything you discussed. One way to make this document is to get the transcript from your AI notetaker, then paste it into chatGPT and ask it to create one for you. However, be sure to manually review and edit.

Post your document to the #externships-fa2025 channel. Priya or an instructor will review it by the end of the day. If no one gets back to you, hound someone down.

By the end of the day, send an email to the founder/eng manager (whoever you met with), and cc Priya, Andrew, and Paris. 

Example email:
*Hi Name,
Great meeting you today. Here's a doc I put together based on what we discussed, please let me know if you have questions. I've gotten started building, and will send you an update at the end of the week.
Best,
Name*

## The Next 2 Weeks

The people giving the internship often aren't good at scoping and don't know how fast y'all are. **The #1 way to open doors and make a good impression is to get the project done much faster than expected.**

This won't always be possible (not all projects are under-scoped), but it is what you should aim for.

If you get stuck or lost, reach out to an instructor. If you think you are falling behind timeline and cannot complete the work in 2 weeks, let an instructor know asap.

On Friday, send an update email to the founder/eng manager, and cc Andrew, Priya, and Paris.

Example email:
*Hi Name,
Just a quick update. So far I have done X, Y, Z, and next week I will work on A, B, C. You can see my current progress here: [link]. Have a great weekend!
Best,
Name*
(Note: what you link, if anything, is dependent on the project. Perhaps your PRs to their codebase, or e.g. a video of what the dashboard looks like so far).
