# Preparing for the Kickoff

The kickoff meeting is your opportunity to understand the externship project and set yourself up for success. You’ll have about 30 minutes to clarify everything you need to know about the project, so preparation is critical.

Steps:
**1. Visit the company’s official website.** Try to get a clear sense of what the company does and who its customers are.
<br>**2. Research the Founder or Employees.** Look up the founder(s) or key team members on LinkedIn.
<br>**3. Read the Ticket Carefully — Twice** You should be able to find this in the calendar invite. 
Depending on who wrote the ticket, it may range from highly detailed to very vague. 
This is also normal in the workplace - whoever is assigning the ticket may not have had a chance to deeply think through the problem themselves, 
or maybe they just haven't had a chance to write it out. Part of  your job is to ask good questions to help them clarify their own thinking and needs,
and to help yourself get all the information you need to succeed.
<br>**4. Write Out a List of Questions** Before the kickoff, draft a clear list of questions to bring to the meeting.
These should help you uncover:
- The desired outcome (What does success look like?)
- The end user (Who are you building for?)
- The scope (What’s included, what’s not?)
- The technical environment (What stack, repo, or tools are being used?)
- The timelines or milestones (When are deliverables due?)
- The review process (Who reviews your work, and how often?)

Make sure you get access to whatever you need, whether that's their codebase, figma files, or anything else.

Don’t worry about having “too many” questions — it’s much better to ask them early than to guess later.
<br>****5. Make sure you have an AI transcriber for the kickoff meeting.** 
[Granola](https://www.granola.ai/), [Otter](https://otter.ai/home), or [Fathom](https://www.fathom.ai/) are good choices. 
If you don't usually use an AI notetaker, please set one up now and do a test run with a friend.

# At the Kickoff

**You will lead the kickoff.**

Steps:
**1. Introduce yourself.** You don't need to give too much context here, just be enthusiastic. "Hi, I'm [name], I'm really excited to work on this project because [X]. How are you today?"
**2. Set the agenda.** Something like: "My plan is to ask you a bunch of questions about the ticket to make sure I understand the work and can get started on this right away. Does that sound good? Is there anything else you want to do on this call?"
**3. Ask your questions.** Ask questions until you understand the ticket and have access to any resources you need.
**4. Thank them and tell them next steps.** "Thank you so much for the context. 
I am going to write up a doc with everything we just discussed and send it over to you by the end of the day.
I'll also get started on the project and reach out to you if I need anything else."

Someone from Fractal Tech will be on the call with you (i.e. Priya, Andrew, Paris, David, or Andy) and can step in if needed. We're also there to make sure the scope doesn't get out of hand, and step in if the company has unrealistic expectations or bad vibes.
