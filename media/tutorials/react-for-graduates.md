Okay, so you've written some react code.

Seriously. If you haven't, this tutorial actually starts over here in our [pre-course material](https://github.com/fractal-bootcamp/precourse-materials) and then continues by taking [our bootcamp](https://fractalbootcamp.com).

If you haven't written 200+ hours of React, just don't really bother with the intermediate stuff, you need to go write code.


### The pre-guide -- Beginner React:
1. [Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e), Scrimba
2. [Foundations of React](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations), NextJS
3. [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/)

### Intermediate React:

If you've gotten this far or come to this page, it's probably because you THOUGHT you knew React, but actually... you don't. Maybe you are running into [race conditions because of useEffect running multiple times due to component re-renders](https://maxrozen.com/race-conditions-fetching-data-react-with-useeffect).

There are a lot of bugs that can be caused because of a misunderstanding of React, and especially a misunderstanding of re-renders.
