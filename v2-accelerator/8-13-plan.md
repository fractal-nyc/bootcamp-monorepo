Next 2 Weeks:
1. Demo Day!
2. Dream Projects -- 2 weeks build your dream project


### Questions:
1. Are CS50 and other premade courses actually bad? (waste of time... was it just entertainment?)
2. Maybe we have people go back and do EloquentJS instead of CS50?


### Things that were good:
1. 45 items in a list -- Standard Library Puzzles


### Changes:
1. NO BREAK. (Instead people can take a Sabbatical)
2. 45 items in a list -- Standard Library Puzzles
3. Run async interviews for students that are graded by the  machine
4. There need to be way more Carrots and Sticks (Internships, Diploma-status, Criteria)
5. Two programs for the price of one



### Plan for Fractal Tech Graduation Sprint + Demo Day:

Hello students,

- Listen, I've been talking to other founders and I've got a HUGE opportunity to bring our NYC tech network to YOU. But these founders and VCs have really high bars, and they want to see some insane shit. Demos that will blow their socks off, and work that they don't think is not possible for students to achieve. We think this is your best single opportunity to get a job before you graduate. Get ready to work hard, and to leverage that hard work to land your job in the tech industry.

- Welcome to Fractal Tech's Graduation Sprint.


## Project Spec: Build Your Dream Demo -- Your Capstone Project

**Requirements for Project Approval:**
- Pitch your idea to us in a short, written memo. We need to see the vision, the technical complexity, and why it's going to make jaws drop at Demo Day.
- Must solve a REAL problem or provide genuine entertainment value - no toy apps or basic CRUD operations
- You must be able to articulate the technical challenges you'll face and your plan to overcome them
- You must defend the project and your plan from our criticism, we will be especially critical of apps that you don't know how to build.

**Project Requirements:**
- Mobile-first design (must work on phones)
- Must have a REAL domain so people at Demo Day can visit the project
- Must have delightful UX
- Polished Design
- Must be truly functional -- strangers using it on their phone must be able to use the app for the intended purpose
- Must be COOL. Wow Factor! Awesome! Insane! Mindboggling! Make us proud!
- Limited scope for demo. Build a tech demo. Do not build a whole startup.
- Idea must be approved by us as sufficiently awesome. You may have an existing project which would fit into this criteria. It does not need to be a brand new idea or codebase.


### Important: Requirements for Graduation

- Success on this final project is a Graduation Requirement. BE ADVISED, students who do not meet these requirements will not graduate, and will not receive the following benefits:
    - post-bootcamp career coaching
    - introductions to employers in our network
    - diploma
    - access to the Fractal Tech Alumni network

- If you do not graduate, we will offer you 1 chance to re-take the Bootcamp next semester.

- In order to graduate you must meet the following requirements:
    - Be in office BEFORE 9am every day. If you're 1 minute late, that's tardy. If you have an unexcused tardy more than once and you are not exceeding performance expectations, we reserve the right to withhold your graduation.
    - 5+ PRs every week day (NOT 3!! You guys have Claude Code.). Do not game this system. We will be selectively reviewing PR submissions, and if we determine that you are faking it, we will be big mad. If you won't be able to acheive this on a particular day, you must give us advance notice as soon as you know. Communicate and Deliver.
    - Present your tech demo at Demo Day. Build something we (and you) are proud of.
    - Be able to answer questions about this codebase. We will pull random snippets of code from the codebase and you must be able to explain what they are, what they do, and why they are important.
    - You must pass a live-coding interview with us, where we will ask you at least 1 standard library puzzle, and at least 1 practical interview. You are guaranteed 2 opportunities to pass, but we reserve the right to give some students more if we determine that to be best.
