### Teach Timeboxing:
- Start with 1 hour and then reflections:
    - what was your intent?
    - what did you actually get done?

### Teach Compound Interest:
- A reason to expose yourself, legibilize yourself, be judged, and receive intense feedback, then process it.
- Get better every day. No zero days.


### Bug Bashes + Demo Days:
- Bug bash before demo day
- Generate tons of bugs and tickets just to get everything out.


### Spec-driven Development & Test-driven Development:
