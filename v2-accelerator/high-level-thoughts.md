In order to v2 the accelerator, we need to go from:

- Intense Cultural Immersion

to 

- Intense Cultural Immersion with Direct, Guided, Instruction

which means we need to develop Direct, Guided Instruction for software engineering.


The first step is always step 0, which is: "has anyone done this before?"

Good examples of "active learning" are:
- practice exams
- difficult tests that require thinking

For instance, if we could emulate this:
