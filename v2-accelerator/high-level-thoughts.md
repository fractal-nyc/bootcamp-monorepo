In order to v2 the accelerator, we need to go from:

- Intense Cultural Immersion

to 

- Intense Cultural Immersion with Direct, Guided, Instruction

which means we need to develop Direct, Guided Instruction for software engineering.


The first step is always step 0, which is: "has anyone done this before?"

So probably we need to do a literature review in order to produce a test (or series of tests ?).

Good examples of "active learning" are:
- practice exams
- difficult tests that require thinking

For instance, if we could emulate this: 
[software design quiz](https://www.mirdin.com/quizzes/software-design-quiz-typescript/)


## Things to do:
- Find or create a "Software Engineering Dictionary"
- Teach Testing
- Teach Drawing Systems (drawing Stripe, drawing Google, drawing Twitter, etc...)
- Office Hours & Work Log (notebook)
    - daily reminders "Office hours start at 3pm today and will END at 5pm. Please bring your questions to the War Room starting at 3pm."
    - if a student has a NON URGENT issue, tell them to write it down in their work log, prepare it, and bring it to office hours tomorrow. Also tell students to write down their issues async.
