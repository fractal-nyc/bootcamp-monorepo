In order to v2 the accelerator, we need to go from:

- Intense Cultural Immersion

to 

- Intense Cultural Immersion with Direct, Guided, Instruction

which means we need to develop Direct, Guided Instruction for software engineering.


The first step is always step 0, which is: "has anyone done this before?"

So probably we need to do a literature review in order to produce a test (or series of tests ?).

Good examples of "active learning" are:
- practice exams
- difficult tests that require thinking

For instance, if we could emulate this: 
[software design quiz](https://www.mirdin.com/quizzes/software-design-quiz-typescript/)


## Things to do:
- Find or create a "Software Engineering Dictionary"
- Teach Testing
- Teach Drawing Systems (drawing Stripe, drawing Google, drawing Twitter, etc...)
-
