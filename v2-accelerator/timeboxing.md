PRIORITIZE:


- when you have a task where you don't know how to get the answer already
- you need to invest some time collecting information, scoping out the domain, coming up with different approaches
- you need to invest a little bit of your time to get as much scope as you can, and THEN either decide to move forward or estimate how much time is actually needed to finish the task.
- how do you prioritize your time?
- how can you manage the risk of not having the right priorities in the first place?
- how can you derisk whether or not your own understanding of the solution is wrong?
- uncertainty management and uncertainty reduction (including hidden uncertainty that you might not be aware of).


In the context of AI:

let's say you have 8 hours:
- do you oneshot the task with your current level of knowledge at the start, and then iterate from that solution to the final solution

OR
- do you timebox 1 hour to exploring a bunch of solutions, a lot of the solution space, and reading a lot of code, and answering
