### Team Exercises to Improve The Curriculum:
1. Read ["how to use CSPrimer"](https://csprimer.com/how/) and take notes to draft a "How to use Fractal Bootcamp" document



### TODO:
- [] A system to ensure that we all understand what every student is doing, and they can't fall through the cracks (PARIS)
- [] A system to check readings, practice, and eod status reports every day (PARIS)
- [] A unit that preps students for using GIT and GIT WORKFLOWS (try Git Butler and Github Desktop and Git Town) (??)
- [] A "50 pieces of advice for junior engineers" document for meta-cognitive skills (MARK?)
- [] Sheet to track all the students (???)
- [] Demo Lesson // Teacher Training for meta-cognitive/coaching skills (MARK)
- [] Design the first 2 workshops for meta-cognitive coaching (MARK)
- [] Review this doc and turn it into more TODOS in this list: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10mYHfOcuK7AQAyru3xrt3P6MTI7ktIRpQWdRhSAB_vE/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.pa4qotaqi7al
- [] Integrate "timeboxing" into the curriculum
- [] Add a "box-checking" exercise that can be completed to quickly learn and implement a bunch of "high status" technologies (kubernetes, AWS, etc etc...)
- [] Once again consider a unit where students contribute to a live codebase (maybe something we build/maintain finally??)
- [] Build daily system design + diagramming + scaffolding exercises for the first 3 weeks of the cohort
- [] Build a "post-precourse" set of exercises (scaffolded game development + fun daily leetcode puzzles??) that students can complete AFTER THEY PASS the precourse eval to prepare for our cohort 
- [] Intellectually scaffold up to understanding the point of "functional programming" and "no side effects" and "pure functions" -- why do we limit effects? why do we copy data? etc...
